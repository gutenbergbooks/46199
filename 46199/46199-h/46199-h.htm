<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="indent">Having learned from some of those kind and esteemed
Friends who lately presented to me a magnificent piece of Plate, in
the name of the Free Masons of Scotland, on the occasion
of my approaching departure for India, that I could not more
suitably evince my sense of gratitude, than by leaving amongst
them, as a token of remembrance, some Memoir of the Order
of the Temple, with which they seem to consider me in some
measure identified, I have, in compliance with their wish,
devoted the very few hours of leisure I have had during the
last month, to the preparation of the following Sketch;&mdash;and
feel confident, that from an individual almost constantly
engaged in arrangements for quitting his Native Country,
and labouring under the most painful feelings, at the prospect
of parting from his family, and those with whom he has lived
in cordial terms of friendship during the last three years, nothing
very finished or original will be expected; and I offer
no apology, therefore, when I state, that a considerable portion
of the following pages consists merely of an abridgement
or reprint of an admirable, but not sufficiently known article,
written by Mr. Keightly, on the History of the Templars,
down to the period of the Persecution, in the Foreign Quarterly
Review for 1828, followed by some Extracts from Laurie's
Free-Masonry, and Mill's History of Chivalry.</p>

<p class="indent">The account of the present state of the Order has
been taken from the official "Manuel des Chevaliers de l'Ordre
du Temple," published both at Paris and Liverpool; as well
as from information gathered either in foreign books, such as
the "Acta Latamorum," in which all the Statutes, &amp;c. were
given to the Public in 1815, or from conversations with
which I have been honoured by His Royal Highness the
<span class="smcap">Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>,
Admiral <span class="smcap">Sir William Sidney Smith</span>, General
<span class="smcap">Wright</span>, and other distinguished Templars, at
home and abroad. For much of the information recorded in the Chapter
on the Scottish Templars, I am under great obligations
to <span class="smcap">Adam Paterson</span>, and
<span class="smcap">William Pringle</span>, Esquires,
both of whom furnished me with valuable Manuscripts. The
latter of these gentlemen is the author of various papers on
the Templars, in that valuable periodical, the Free-Masons'
Review, nor was it until I had failed to induce him to give,
in a continuous form, the result of his own researches on the
subject, that I myself ventured to enter upon the present Work.</p>

<p class="indent">In conclusion, I have to express my warmest acknowledgments
to my friend, <span class="smcap">W. A. Laurie</span>, Esquire, Secretary to
the Grand Lodge of Scotland, for many valuable notes and
additions,&mdash;to whose taste and exertions this little Volume
owes its appearance before the Public, and to whom personally
I am indebted for many favours, which he would not
wish me to particularise.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The natural desire to visit
places which have been the scene of memorable
actions, or the abode of distinguished
personages, had from a very early period
drawn pious pilgrims from the east and
the west to view those spots which had
been hallowed by the presence of the Son
of God. The toils and the dangers of the
journey were unheeded, when set in comparison
with the bliss of pouring forth
prayer on Calvary, and bathing in the waves of Jordan,
whose waters had consecrated the Saviour to his holy office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
And, accordingly, we find that, so early as the ninth century,
there was in the valley of Jehoshaphat, near the church of
the Holy Virgin, an Hospital composed of twelve dwellings,
for pilgrims from the west, which possessed corn lands, vineyards,
and gardens, and an excellent library, established by
the bounty of Charlemagne.</p>

<p class="indent">In the eleventh century, when the apprehension
of the approaching end of the world, and appearance of Christ to
judge mankind, had once more fanned the flame of pious
pilgrimage which had been previously dying away, and men
were hastening to the land where they expected to meet their
Lord and Judge, there was built within the walls of Jerusalem
an Hospital for the reception of Catholic pilgrims. This
hospital stood within a very short distance of the church of
the Holy Sepulchre, and, by the favour of the Egyptian
Khalif, a church, dedicated to the Virgin, and afterwards
called St. Maria de Latina, was erected close by it; there an
abbot and several monks, who followed the rule of St. Benedict,
received and entertained the pilgrims who arrived each
year from the west, and furnished such of them as were poor
or had been plundered by the roving Bedouins, with the
means of paying the tax exacted by the unbelievers. Decorum
not permitting the reception of female pilgrims, the
brethren established without their walls a convent, dedicated
to Mary Magdalene, where a pious sisterhood entertained
the pilgrims of their own sex. The number of the pilgrims
still continuing to increase, the abbot and his monks erected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
a new <i>Hospitium</i> near their church, which they placed under
the patronage of St. John, the Patriarch of Alexandria, named
Eleemon, or the Compassionate. This last Hospital had
no independent revenues, but derived its income from the
bounty of the abbot of the monastery of the Holy Virgin,
and the alms of the pious.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When, in 1099, Jerusalem was invested by the
Crusaders, the Hospital of St. John was presided over by Gerhard,
a native of Provence, a man of exemplary piety, and of a spirit
of mild and universal benevolence, rarely to be found in that
age; for while the city was pressed by the arms of the faithful,
who sought for future glory by the extermination of
those whom they deemed the enemies of God on earth, not
merely the orthodox Catholic, but the schismatic Greek, and
even the unbelieving Moslem, shared without distinction the
alms of the good director of the Hospital of St. John. When
the city was taken, the sick and wounded of the Crusaders
received all due care and attention from Gerhard and his
monks. The general favour they enjoyed with Godfrey de
Bouillon and the other pilgrims now emboldened them to
separate themselves from the monastery of St. Mary de Latina;
and to pursue their labour of love alone and independent,
they drew up a rule for themselves, to which they bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
themselves to obedience in the presence of the patriarch, and
assumed as their distinguishing dress, a black mantle, with a
white cross of eight points on the left breast.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
They still remained obedient to the abbot of St. Maria de Latina,
and according to the law of the church, they paid tythes to the
patriarch.</p>

<p class="indent">This continued while the brotherhood was poor;
but riches soon began to flow in upon them. Godfrey, whose very
name suggests the ideas of virtue and piety, pure, if not always
well-directed, struck with their simple and unassuming
charity, bestowed on them his domain of Monboire, in Brabant,
with all its appurtenances. His brother and successor,
Baldwin, gave them a portion of the booty gained from the
infidels; several pious princes and nobles followed these examples,
and the Hospital of St. John soon saw itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
possession of extensive estates, both in Europe<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and Asia, which were managed by members of the society named Preceptors.
Pope Pascall II, in 1113, relieved the Hospitallers from the
burden of paying tythes to the patriarch of Jerusalem&mdash;confirmed
by his Bull all donations made and to be made to them&mdash;and
gave them authority to appoint a successor on the
death of Gerhard, without the interference of any other
secular or spiritual authority. The society now counted
among its members many gallant knights who had come to
the Holy Land to fight in the cause of their Saviour; and
there, actuated by a spirit more accordant to his, had flung
aside their swords, and devoted themselves to the attendance
on the sick and poor among the brethren of St. John. One
of the most distinguished of these was Raymond Dupuy, a
knight of Dauphiné, who, on the death of the worthy Gerhard,
was chosen to succeed him in his office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It was Raymond who organized the order of the
Hospitallers, and established the discipline of the order. His
regulations afford a specimen of the manners and modes of thinking
of his time; and some of them require to be noticed here, on
account of their similarity with those of the Templars, shortly
to be mentioned. The usual monkish duties of chastity and
obedience were strictly enjoined; the brethren, both lay and
spiritual, were directed to wear at least a linen or woollen
shirt, but no expensive dress of any kind; above all, no furs;
when they went to collect alms, they were, for fear of temptation,
never to go alone, but always in parties of two or three;
they were not, however, to select their companions, but to
take such as the director should appoint them; wherever
there was a house belonging to their order, they were to turn
in thither, and nowhere else, and to take whatever was given
them, and ask for nothing more; they were also to carry
their lights with them, and wherever they passed the night,
to set these burning before them, lest the enemy should bring
on them some deadly danger. When the brethren were in
the church, or in a private house, in the company of women,
they were to take good heed to themselves and avoid temptation;
for the same reason, they were never to suffer women
to wash their head or feet, or to make their bed. If a brother
had fallen into carnal sin, and his offence was secret, a silent
penance was deemed sufficient; but if it had been public, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
he was fully convicted of it, he was on Sunday, after mass,
when the people were gone out of church, to be stript of his
clothes, and there, by the director himself, or such of the
brethren as he appointed, severely beaten with thongs or rods,
and then expelled the order. Any brother possessed of money
or valuables, who concealed them from the master, was severely
punished, the money which he had secreted was hung
about the offender's neck, and he was scourged by one of the
brethren, in the presence of all those belonging to the house;
he had then to do penance for forty days, during which time,
on Wednesdays and Fridays, he had nothing but bread and
water to support him. These regulations were made by Raymond,
in the year 1118; a circumstance to be attended to, as
some similar rules have been since made a ground of accusation
against the Templars.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">It is uncertain whether Raymond had any ulterior
design of making the order of the Hospitallers a military one, but
if such was his intention, he was anticipated. The kingdom of
Jerusalem, over which Baldwin II. now ruled, had been in a
very extraordinary state from the date of its conquest. It
lay between two enemies, the Egyptians on the south, and
the Turks on the north; and these Moslems, though of opposite
and hostile sects, agreed in hatred of the Christians,
and a desire to take Jerusalem&mdash;which was to them also the
Holy City&mdash;out of the hands of the western infidels; the
independent Arabs of the desert were also inimical to the
Christians, and as fond of plunder as they have been at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
periods of their history. Hence, the Holy Land was continually
infested by predatory bands, who robbed and plundered
all who fell in their way; the pious pilgrim who disembarked
at Joppa or Acre, was fortunate if he reached the
ultimate object of his journey in safety; and when he had
visited all the consecrated places within the sacred walls, new
perils awaited him on his way to bathe in the purifying
waters of the Jordan, or to pluck in the gardens of Jericho
the palm branch which he was to suspend in the church on
his return.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Knights Templars.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/deco_i.jpg" alt="I" width="60" height="80" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">It was in the year 1119, the
twentieth of the Christian dominion in Syria,
that nine pious and valiant Knights, the
greater part of whom had been the companions
of Godfrey de Bouillon, formed
themselves into an association, the object
of which was to protect and defend Pilgrims
on their visits to the holy places.
These Knights, of whom the two chief were Hugo de Payens
and Godfrey de St. Omer, vowed, in honour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<i>sweet Mother of God</i>, to unite Monkhood and Knighthood;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
their pious design met with the warm approbation of the King and
the Patriarch, and in the hands of the latter they made the
three ordinary vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience; and
a fourth, of combating without ceasing against the heathen,
in defence of Pilgrims and of the Holy Land; and bound
themselves to live according to the rule of the canons of St.
Augustine, at Jerusalem. The King assigned them for their
abode a part of his palace, which stood close by where had
stood the Temple of the Lord. He and his barons contributed
to their support, and the abbot and canons of the Temple
assigned them for the keeping of their arms and magazines
the street between it and the royal palace, and hence
they took the name of the soldiery of the Temple, or Templars.
When Fulk, Count of Anjou, in the year following
the formation of the society, made a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, the Order was even then in such repute that he joined
it as a married brother, and on his return home remitted
them annually thirty pounds of silver to aid them in their
pious labours, and his example was followed by several other
Christian princes.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first nine years after their institution,
the Templars lived in poverty and humility, and no new members joined
their society, which was eclipsed by that of St. John. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
clothing consisted of such garments as were bestowed on
them by the charity of the faithful, and so rigorously were
the gifts of pious princes applied by them to their destination&mdash;the
benefit of pilgrims and of the Holy Land in general&mdash;that
in consequence of their poverty, Hugo de Payens
and Godfrey de St. Omer had but one war-horse between
them. When the Order had arrived at wealth and splendour,
its seal, representing two Knights mounted on one
charger, commemorated this original poverty of its pious
founders.</p>

<p class="indent">During the reign of Baldwin II. the kingdom was
hard pressed by the Turks of Damascus, Mossul, and the neighbouring
states, and the king had been a captive in their hands.
On his liberation he sought every means of strengthening
his kingdom, and as the Templars had displayed such eminent
valour and devotion wherever they had been engaged,
he resolved to gain them all the influence and consideration
in his power. Accordingly he dispatched two of their members
as his envoys to the Holy See, to lay before the Pope
the state of the Holy Land, and also furnished them with a
strong letter of recommendation to the celebrated Bernard
of Clairvaux, the nephew of one of the envoys. Bernard
approved highly of the object and institution of the Order.
Hugo de Payens and five other brethren soon arrived in the
west, and appeared before the fathers, who were assembled
in council at Troyes, to whom Hugo detailed the maxims
and the deeds of the Templars. The fathers expressed their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
approbation of all he said, the Order was pronounced good
and useful, and same additions, taken from that of the Benedictines,
were made to their rule. By the direction of Pope
Honorius, the council appointed them a white mantle as
their peculiar dress, to which Pope Eugenius some years
afterwards added a red cross on the breast&mdash;the symbol of
martyrdom. Their banner was of the black and white stripe,
called, in old French, <i>Bauseant</i> (which word became their
war-cry,) and bore the pious inscription, <i>Non nobis, Domine,
non nobis, sed nomini tua da gloriam</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
St. Bernard, if he did not himself draw up the rule of Order, had
at least a considerable participation in it; throughout his life
he cherished the Templars; he rarely wrote a letter to the Holy
Land, in which he did not praise them, and recommend them
to the favour and protection of the great.</p>

<p class="indent">Owing to the influence of Bernard, and the sincere
piety and noble qualities of its founders, the Order rapidly
increased in wealth and consequence. Many Knights assumed
its habit, and with Hugo de Payens travelled through France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and England, to excite the Christians to the sacred war.
With Henry I. of England they met the highest consideration.
Fulk, of Anjou, re-united himself to Hugo de Payens,
and on the invitation of King Baldwin, prepared, though
advanced in years, to set out for Palestine, to espouse the
daughter of the king, and succeed him on his throne. Gifts
in abundance flowed in on the Order, large possessions were
bestowed on it in all countries of the west, and Hugo de
Payens, now its Grand Master, returned to the Holy Land
in the year 1129, at the head of three hundred Knights
Templars of the noblest families in Europe, ready to take
the field against the Infidels.</p>

<p class="indent">The Templars soon became, in fact, the most
distinguished of the Christian warriors. By a rule of their Order,
no brother could be redeemed for a higher ransom than a girdle
or a knife, or some such trifle;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
captivity was therefore equivalent to death, and they always fought
with Spartan desperation. The Bauseant was always in the thick of
the battle; the revenue they enjoyed enabled them to draw to
their standard valiant secular knights and stout and hardy
footmen. The chivalry of St. John vied with them, it is
true, in prowess and valour, but they do not occupy the
same space in the History of the Crusades. The Templars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
having been from the outset solely devoted to arms,&mdash;the
warm interest which St. Bernard, whose influence was so
great, took in their welfare,&mdash;and the circumstance that the
fourth King of Jerusalem was a member of their body,&mdash;all
combined to throw a splendour about them which the Knights
of St. John could not claim, but which also gave occasion to
their more speedy corruption, and augmented the number of
their enemies. Most writers, however, of the twelfth century
speak respectfully of the Knights of the Temple, and
those unsparing satirists, the Troubadours, never mention
them but with honour. The history of the Order, as far as
we can recollect, records only one instance of a Templar abjuring
his faith, and that was an English Knight, Robert of
Saint Albans, who deserted to Saladin, who gave him his
sister in marriage on his becoming a Moslem; and in 1185,
the ex-red-cross Knight led a Saracen army to the neighbourhood
of Jerusalem, wasting and destroying the country
with fire and sword.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="indent">By the Bull, <i>Omne datum optimum</i>, granted
by Pope Alexander III. in 1162, the Order of the Templars acquired
great importance, and from this time forth, it may be regarded
as totally independent, acknowledging no authority but
that&mdash;before which the haughtiest monarchs bowed&mdash;of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
supreme pontiff, who protected and favoured them as his
champions against all who might dispute his will. It is
therefore of importance to look at its constitution, and what
were its revenues and possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">The Order of the Templars consisted of three distinct
<i>classes</i>, not <i>degrees</i>&mdash;knights, chaplains, and service-brethren,
to which may be added those who were attached to the Order
under the name of <i>affiliated</i>, <i>donates</i>, and <i>oblates</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The strength and flower of the Order were the Knights; all its
dignities and superior offices belonged to them. The candidate
for admission among the Knights of the Temple was required
to produce proof of his being the lawful issue of a Knight, or
of one qualified to receive that distinction; and he must himself
have already received the honour-conferring blow from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a Secular Knight, for the Order was Spiritual, and, as members,
could not deign to accept honour from a layman. The
only exception was in the case of a bishop, who might draw
his sword among the brethren of the Temple, without having
been a secular Knight. The aspirant must moreover be free
from debt, and, on admission, pay a considerable sum into the
hands of the society.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The most unlimited obedience to the
commands of his superiors in the house and in the field of
battle; the total abnegation of all interests but those of the
society, (for the Templar could hold no property, could receive
no private letter); the most unflinching valour, (for so
long as a Christian banner waved in the field, the Templar,
however severely wounded, must not abandon it),&mdash;were the
duties of the Knights of the Temple. If he fled, disgrace and
punishment awaited him; if he surrendered, he had to end
his life amid the torments inflicted by the enraged Moslems,
or to languish in perpetual captivity, for the Order never redeemed
its members. Hence, then, the Templar was valiant
as the fabled heroes of romance; hence prodigies of prowess,
such as almost surpass belief, so frequently illustrate the name
of the soldiers of the Temple. Every motive that could stimulate
to deeds of renown combined to actuate the soldier-monk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
A Knight, he obeyed the call of honour and emulation;
a Monk, (but the Templar was not, as some erroneously
fancy, a Priest), he was, according to the ideas of the
times, engaged in the service most acceptable to God.</p>

<p class="indent">The mode of reception into the Order corresponded
with the dignity and importance of the character of a Knight
Templar. Though a noviciate was enjoined by the original
canons, in practice it was dispensed with; the candidate was,
after all due inquiry had been made, received in a chapter
assembled in the chapel of the Order. All strangers, even
the relatives of the aspirant, were excluded. The preceptor
(usually one of the priors) opened the business with an address
to those present, calling on them to declare if they
knew of any just cause and impediment to the aspirant, whom
the majority had agreed to receive, becoming a member of
their body.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
If all were silent, the candidate was led into
an adjacent chamber, whither two or three of the Knights
came to him, and setting before him the rigour and strictness
of the Order, inquired if he still persisted in his desire to
enter it. If he did persist, they inquired if he was married
or betrothed; had made a vow in any other Order; if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
owed more than he could pay; if he was of sound body,
without any secret infirmity, and free? If his answers proved
satisfactory, they left him and returned to the chapter, and
the preceptor again asked if any one had anything to say
against his being received. If all were silent, he asked if
they were willing to admit him. On their assenting, the
candidate was led in by the Knights who had questioned
him, and who now instructed him in the mode of asking admission.
He advanced, kneeling, with folded hands, before
the preceptor, and said, "Sir, I am come before God, and
before you and the brethren; and I pray and beseech you,
for the sake of God and our sweet lady, to receive me into
your society and the good works of the Order, as one who,
all his life long, will be the servant and slave of the Order."
The preceptor then questioned him, if he had well considered
all the toils and difficulties which awaited him in the Order,
adjured him on the Holy Evangelists to speak the truth,
then put to him the questions already asked by the Knights,
farther inquiring if he was a Knight, the son of a Knight
and a gentlewoman, and if he was a priest. He then asked
if he would promise to God and Mary, our dear lady, obedience,
as long as he lived, to the Master of the Temple, and
the prior who should be set over him; chastity of his body;
<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
compliance with the laudable manners and customs of the
Order then in force, and such as the Master and Knights
might hereafter add; fight for and defend, with all his might,
the holy land of Jerusalem; never quit the Order but with
consent of the Master and the Chapter; never see a Christian
unjustly deprived of his inheritance, or be aiding in such
deed. The preceptor then said&mdash;"In the name, then, of
God and of Mary, our dear lady, and in the name of St.
Peter of Rome, and of our father the Pope, and in the name
of all the brethren of the Temple, we receive you to all the
good works of the Order, which have been performed from
the beginning, and will be performed to the end, you, your
father, your mother, and all those of your family whom you
let participate therein. So you, in like manner, receive us to
all the good works which you have performed and will perform.
We assure you of bread and water, the poor clothing of the
Order, and labour and toil enow." The preceptor then took
the white mantle, with its ruddy cross, placed it about his
neck, and bound it fast. The chaplain repeated the one
hundred and thirty-second Psalm, <i>Ecce quam bonum</i>, and
the prayer of the Holy Spirit, <i>Deus qui corda fidelium</i>,
each brother said a <i>Pater</i>, the preceptor kissed the new
brother, the chaplain did the same. The Templar then
placed himself at the feet of the preceptor, and was by him
exhorted to peace and charity with his brother Christians;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to chastity, obedience, humility, and piety; and thus the
ceremony ended.</p>

<p class="indent">At the head of the Order stood the Grand Master,
who, like the General of the Jesuits in modern times, was independent
of all authority but that of the sovereign pontiff.
The residence of the Grand Master was the city of Jerusalem;
when the city was lost, he fixed his seat at Antioch,
next at Acre, then at the castle of the Pilgrims,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
between Caiphas and Cæsarea, and finally in Cyprus, for his
duty required him to be always in the Holy Land. The Grand
Master never resided in Europe until the time of Jacques de
Molay. The power of the Grand Master was considerable,
though he was very much controuled by the chapter, without
whose consent he could not dispose of any of the higher
offices, or undertake any thing of importance. He could
not, for instance, take money out of the treasury, without
the consent of the prior of Jerusalem; he could neither make
war or truce, or alter laws, but with the approbation of the
chapter. But the Grand Master had the right of bestowing
the small commands, the governments of houses of the Order,
and of selecting the brethren who should form the chapter,
which power was again controuled by there being always
assigned him two brethren as assistants, who, with the
Seneschal, were to form a part of every chapter. The Order
was aristocratic rather than monarchic; the Grand Master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was like a Doge of Venice, and his real power chiefly depended
on his personal qualities; he had, however, many
distinctions; the greater part of the executive power was in
his hands&mdash;in war he was the commander-in-chief; he had,
as vicar-general of the Pope, episcopal jurisdiction over the
clergy of the Order; he ranked with princes, and his establishment
corresponded thereto; he had for his service four
horses, a chaplain, two secretaries, a squire of noble birth, a
farrier, a Turcopole and cook, with footmen, and a Turcoman
for a guide, who was usually fastened by a cord to prevent
his escape. When the Grand Master died, his funeral
was celebrated with great solemnity by the light of torches
and wax tapers,&mdash;an honour bestowed by the Order on no
other of its Members. All the Knights and Prelates were
invited to assist. Each Brother who was present was to repeat
two hundred <i>Pater Nosters</i> within the space of seven
days, for the repose of the soul of the deceased; and one
hundred poor persons were fed at home, at the expense of
the Order, with the same design.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Each province of the Order had a Grand Prior,
who represented in it the Grand Master; each house had its Prior
at its head, who commanded its Knights in war, and presided
over its chapters in peace. In England, the Grand Prior
sat in Parliament as a Peer of the Realm. To complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
this sketch of the Order, we may remark, that except Scandinavia,
(for they had some possessions in Hungary,) there
was not a country in Europe in which the lavish piety of
princes and nobles had not bestowed on the Templars a considerable
portion of the wealth of the state; for in every
province the Order had its churches and chapels&mdash;the number
of which was in the year 1240, as great as 1050&mdash;villages,
farm-houses, mills, corn-lands, pastures, woods, rights
of venison, and fisheries.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The revenues of the Templars in England in 1185, as given by Dugdale,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
will afford some idea of their wealth. The entire annual income of the
Order has been estimated at not less than six millions sterling.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">It cannot be denied, that this enormous wealth,
together with the luxury and other evils which it engendered, provoked
the hatred of the secular clergy and laity, and paved
the way to the spoliation of the Order. In 1252, the pious
pope-ridden Henry III. of England said, that the prelates
and clergy in general, but especially the Templars and Hospitallers,
had so many liberties and privileges, that their excessive
wealth made them mad with pride; he added, that
what had been bestowed imprudently, ought to be prudently
resumed, and declared his intention of revoking the inconsiderate
grants of himself and his predecessors. The Grand
Prior of the Templars replied, "What sayest thou, my Lord
the King? Far be it that so discourteous and absurd a word
should be uttered by thy mouth. So long as thou observest
justice, thou mayest be a king, and as soon as thou infringest
it, thou wilt cease to be a king." A bold expression certainly,
but the Prior knew his man well, and he would hardly
have spoken so to the son of Henry. The anecdote of
Richard I. bestowing his daughter Pride in marriage on the
Templars, is well known; and numerous traits of their
haughtiness, avarice, luxury, and other of the current vices,
may be found in the writers of the thirteenth century; but
till the final attack was made, no worse charge was brought
against them, unless such is implied in a bull of Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Clement IV. in 1265, which is, however, easily capable of a
milder interpretation. Mr. Raynouard asserts, too, that the
proverbial expression <i>bibere Templariter</i> is used by no writer
of the thirteenth century. In this he is preceded by Baluze
and Roquefort, who maintain, that, like <i>bibere Papaliter</i>, it
only signified to live in abundance and comfort.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When Acre fell in 1292, the
Templars, having lost all their possessions
and a great number of their members in the
Holy Land, retired with the other
Christians to Cyprus. Having probably
seen the folly of all hope of recovering
the Holy Land, they grew indifferent about it;
few members joined them from Europe, and it is more
than probable that they meditated a removal of the chief
seat of the Order to France.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The Hospitallers, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
other hand, with more prudence, as events showed, resolved
to continue the war against the infidels, and they
attacked and conquered Rhodes; while the Teutonic knights
transferred the sphere of their pious warfare to Prussia against
its heathen inhabitants. Thus, while the Templars were
falling under the reproach of being luxurious Knights, their
rivals rose in consideration, and there was an active and inveterate
enemy ready to take advantage of their ill-repute.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">Philip the Fair, a tyrannical and rapacious prince,
was at that time on the throne of France. His darling object was
to set the power of the monarchy above that of the church.
In his celebrated controversy with Pope Boniface, the Templars
had been on the side of the Holy See. Philip, whose
animosity pursued Boniface even beyond the grave, wished
to be revenged on all who had taken his side; moreover,
the immense wealth of the Templars, which he reckoned on
making his own if he could destroy them, strongly attracted
the king, who had already tasted of the sweets of the spoliation
of the Lombards and the Jews; and he probably, also,
feared the obstacle to the perfect establishment of despotism
which might be offered by a numerous, noble, and wealthy
society, such as the Templars formed. Boniface's successor,
Clement V. was the creature of Philip, to whom he owed his
dignity, and at his accession had bound himself to the performance
of six articles in favour of Philip, one of which was
not expressed. It was probably inserted without any definite
object, and intended to serve the interest of the French monarch
on any occasion which might present itself.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
It had been the object of Pope Boniface
to form the three Military Orders into one, and he had summoned them
to Rome for that purpose, but his death prevented it. Clement,
on this, June 6, 1306, addressed the Grand Masters of the
Templars and the Hospitallers, inviting them to come to consult
with him about the best mode of supporting the Kings
of Armenia and Cyprus. He desired them to come as secretly
as possible, and with a very small train, as they would
find abundance of their Knights this side the sea; and he
directed them to provide for the defence of Limisso in Cyprus
during their short absence. Fortunately perhaps for himself
and his Order, the Master of the Hospitallers was then engaged
in the conquest of Rhodes, but Jacques de Molay,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
the Master of the Templars, immediately prepared to obey
the mandate of the Pope, and he left Cyprus with a train of
60 Knights, and a treasure of 150,000 florins of gold, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
great quantity of silver money, the whole requiring twelve
horses to carry it.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
He proceeded to Paris, where he was received with the
greatest honours by the King, and he deposited
his treasure in the Temple of that city. It is, as we
have said, not impossible that it was the intention of Molay
to transfer the chief seat of the Order thither, and that he
had, therefore, brought with him its treasure and the greater
part of the members of the chapter; and indeed it is difficult
to say how early the project of attacking the Templars entered
into the minds of Philip and his obsequious lawyers, or
whether he originally aimed at more than mulcting them
under the pretext of reformation: and farther, whether the
first informers against them were suborned or not. The records
leave a considerable degree of obscurity on the whole
matter. All we can learn is, that a man named Squin de
Flexian, who had been a Prior of the Templars, and had
been expelled the Order for heresy and various vices, was
lying in prison at Paris or Toulouse, it is uncertain which.
In the prison with him was a Florentine named Noffo Dei,
"a man," says Villani, "full of all iniquity." These two
began to plan how they might extricate themselves from the
confinement to which they seemed perpetually doomed. The
example of the process against the memory of Pope Boniface,
shewed them that no lie was too gross or absurd not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
obtain ready credence, and they fixed on the Templars as the
objects of their charges. Squin told the governor of the
prison that he had a communication to make to the King,
which would be of more value to him than if he had gained
a kingdom, but that he would only tell it to the King in person.
He was brought to Philip, who promised him his life,
and he made his confession, on which the King immediately
arrested some of the Templars, who are said to have confirmed
the truth of Squin's assertions. Shortly afterwards,
it is said, similar discoveries were made to the Pope by his
chamberlain, Cardinal Cantilupo, who had been in connexion
with the Templars from his eleventh year.</p>

<p class="indent">Squin Flexian declared, <b>1.</b> That every member
on admission into the Order swore on all occasions to defend its
interests right or wrong; <b>2.</b> That the heads of the Order were
in secret confederacy with the Saracens, had more of Mahommedan
unbelief than of Christian faith, as was proved by the
mode of reception into the Order, when the novice was made
to spit and trample on the crucifix, and blaspheme the faith
of Christ; <b>3.</b> That the superiors were sacrilegious, cruel,
and heretical murderers; for if any novice, disgusted with
its profligacy, wished to quit the Order, they secretly murdered
him, and buried him by night; so, also, when women
were pregnant by them, they taught them how to produce
abortion, or secretly put the infants to death; <b>4.</b> The Templars
were addicted to the error of the Fraticelli, and, like
them, despised the authority of the Pope and the Church;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<b>5.</b> That the superiors were addicted to the practice of horrible
crimes, and if any one opposed them, they were condemned
by the Master to perpetual imprisonment; <b>6.</b> That their houses
were the abode of every vice and iniquity; <b>7.</b> That they endeavoured
to put the Holy Land into the hands of the Saracens,
whom they favoured more than the Christians. Three other
articles of less importance completed this first body of charges.
It is remarkable, that we do not find among them those which
made such a figure in the subsequent examinations; namely,
the devil appearing among them in the shape of a cat; their
idolatrous worship of an image with one or three heads, or a
skull covered with human skin, with carbuncles for eyes, before
which they burned the bodies of their dead brethren, and
then mingled the ashes with their drink, thereby thinking to
gain more courage; and, finally, their smearing this idol with
human fat.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was unfortunate for the Templars that their chapters
were held in secret,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and by night, for an opportunity was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
thereby afforded to their enemies of laying whatever secret
enormities they pleased to their charge, to refute which, by
the production of indifferent witnesses, was consequently out
of their power. Philip having now all things prepared, sent,
like his descendant Charles IX. previous to the St. Bartholomew
massacre, secret orders to all his governors to arm themselves
on the 12th of October, and on the following night,
but not sooner, on pain of death, to open the king's letter,
and act according to it. On Friday the 13th of October, all
the Templars throughout France were simultaneously arrested
at break of day. The unhappy Knights were thrown into
cold cheerless dungeons, (for they were arrested, we should
remember, at the commencement of winter), had barely the
necessaries of life, were deprived of the habit of their Order,
and of the rites and comforts of the church; were exposed to
every species of torture then in use, were shown a real or
pretended letter of the Grand Master, in which he confessed
several of the charges, and exhorted them to do the same;
and finally, were promised life and liberty, if they freely
acknowledged the guilt of the Order. Can we then be surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that the spirit of many a Knight was broken, that any hope
of escape from misery was eagerly caught at, and that falsehoods,
the most improbable, were declared to be true? And
it is remarkable that the most improbable charges are those
which were most frequently acknowledged, so just is the observation,
that men will more readily in such circumstances
acknowledge what is false than what is true; for the false
they know can be afterwards refuted by its own absurdity,
whereas truth is permanent.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the Templars in England 228 were examined;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
the Dominican, Carmelite, Minorite, and Augustinian friars
brought abundance of hearsay evidence against them, but nothing
of any importance was proved; in Castile and Leon it
was the same; in Aragon the Knights bravely endured the
torture, and maintained their innocence; in Germany all the
lay witnesses testified in their favour; in Italy their enemies
were more successful, as the influence of the Pope was there
considerable, yet in Lombardy the Bishops acquitted the
Knights. Charles of Anjou, the cousin of Philip, and the
foe of the Templars, who had sided with Frederick against
him, could not fail, it may be supposed, in getting some evidences
of their guilt in Sicily, Naples, and Provence. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
not undeserving of attention, that one of these witnesses, who
had been received into the Order in Catalonia, (where all
who were examined had declared the innocence of the Order),
said he had been received there in the usual impious
and indecent manner, and mentioned the appearance and the
worship of the cat in the chapter!! Such is the value of
rack-extorted testimony! In fine, in every country out of
the sphere of the immediate influence of Clement, Philip, and
Charles, the general innocence of the Order was acknowledged.
In Portugal they were preserved under the altered
appellation of the Knights of Christ,&mdash;a change which was
effected by the friendly policy of Prince Denys, who in 1218,
secured for them the sanction of the successor of Clement.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the entire process against the Templars,
from October 1307 to May 1312, the most determined design of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the King and his ministers to destroy the Order meets us at
every step; Philip would have blood to justify robbery;
several Templars had already expired on the rack, perished
from the rigour of their imprisonment, or died by their own
hands; but on the 12th May 1310, fifty-four Templars who
had confessed, but afterwards retracted, were by his order
committed to the flames, in Paris, as relapsed heretics. They
endured with heroic constancy the most cruel tortures, asserting
with their latest breath the innocence of the Order,
though offered life if they would confess, and implored to
do so by their friends and relatives. Similar executions
took place in other towns. The Pope soon went heart and
hand with Philip. In vain did the bishops assembled at
Vienne propose to hear those members who came forward as
the defenders of the Order. A Bull of the Pope was fulminated
against the Order,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and transferred its possessions to the
Knights of St. John, who, however, had to pay such enormous
fines to the King and Pope before they could enter on
them, as almost ruined them; so that if Philip did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
succeed to the utmost of his anticipations, he had little reason
to complain of his share.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The members of the society of the Templars were permitted
to enter that of the Hospitallers,&mdash;a strange indulgence
for those that had spitten on the cross, and practised horrible vices.</p>

<p class="indent">But the atrocious scene was yet to come which
was to complete the ruin of the Templars, and satiate the
vengeance of their enemies. Their Grand Master, Molay, and three
other dignitaries of the Order, still survived: And, though
they had made the most submissive acknowledgments to their
unrelenting persecutors, yet the influence which they had
over the minds of the vulgar, and their connection with many
of the Princes of Europe, rendered them formidable and
dangerous to their oppressors. By the exertion of that influence,
they might restore union to their dismembered party,
and inspire them with courage to revenge the murder of their
companions;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
or, by adopting a more cautious method, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
might repel, by uncontrovertible proofs, the charges for
which they suffered; and, by interesting all men in their
behalf, they might expose Philip to the attacks of his own
subjects, and to the hatred and contempt of Europe. Aware
of the dangers to which his character and person would be
exposed by pardoning the surviving Templars, the French
Monarch commanded the Grand Master and his Brethren to
be led out to a scaffold, erected for the purpose, and there to
confess before the public, the enormities of which their Order
had been guilty, and the justice of the punishment which had
been inflicted on their brethren. If they adhered to their
former confession, a full pardon was promised to them; but
if they should persist in maintaining their innocence, they
were threatened with destruction on a pile of wood, which the
executioners had erected in their view, to awe them into compliance.
While the multitude were standing around in awful
expectation, ready, from the words of the prisoners, to justify
or condemn their King, the venerable Molay, with a cheerful
and undaunted countenance, advanced, in chains, to the
edge of the scaffold; and, with a firm and impressive tone,
thus addressed the spectators.&mdash;"It is but just, that in this
terrible day, and in the last moments of my life, I lay open
the iniquity of falsehood, and make truth to triumph. I declare
then, in the face of heaven and earth, and I confess,
though to my eternal shame and confusion, that I have committed
the greatest of crimes; but it has been only in acknowledging
those that have been charged with so much
virulence upon an Order, which truth obliges me to pronounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
innocent. I made the first declaration they required
of me, only to suspend the excessive tortures of the rack,
and mollify those that made me endure them. I am sensible
what torments they prepare for those that have courage to
revoke such a confession. But the horrible sight which they
present to my eyes, is not capable of making me confirm one
lie by another. On a condition so infamous as that, I freely
renounce life, which is already but too odious to me. For
what would it avail me to prolong a few miserable days,
when I must owe them only to the blackest of calumnies."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
In consequence of this manly revocation, the Grand Master
and his companions were hurried into the flames, where they
retained that contempt for death which they had exhibited
on former occasions. This mournful scene extorted tears
from the lowest of the vulgar.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Four valiant Knights, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
charity and valour had procured them the gratitude and applause
of mankind, suffering, without fear, the most cruel
and ignominious death, was, indeed, a spectacle well calculated
to excite emotions of pity in the hardest hearts. Humanity
shudders at the recital of the horrid deed; and if the
voice of impartial posterity has not, with one accord, pronounced
the unqualified acquittal of the Templars, it has
branded with the mark of eternal infamy the conduct of
their accusers and judges.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">But the persecution of the
Templars in the fourteenth century does not close
the history of the Order; for, though the
Knights were spoliated, the Order was
not annihilated. In truth, the cavaliers
were not guilty,&mdash;the brother hood was not suppressed,&mdash;and,
startling as is the assertion, there has been a succession
of Knights Templars from the twelfth century down even
to these days; the chain of transmission is perfect in all its

links. Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master at the time
of the persecution, anticipating his own martyrdom, appointed
as his successor, in power and dignity, Johannes Marcus
Larmenius of Jerusalem, and from that time to the present
there has been a regular and uninterrupted line of Grand
Masters. The charter<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
by which the supreme authority
has been transmitted, is judicial and conclusive evidence of
the Order's continued existence. The charter of transmission,
with the signatures of the various chiefs of the Temple,
is still preserved at Paris, with the ancient statutes of the
Order, the rituals, the records, the seals, the standards, and
other memorials of the early Templars.</p>

<p class="indent">The brotherhood has been headed by the bravest cavaliers
of France, by men who, jealous of the dignities of Knighthood,
would admit no corruption, no base copies of the orders of
chivalry, and who thought that the shield of their nobility
was enriched by the impress of the Templars' red cross.
Bertrand du Guesclin was the Grand Master from 1357 till
his death in 1380, and he was the only French commander
who prevailed over the chivalry of our Edward III. From
1478 to 1497, we may mark Robert Lenoncourt, a cavalier
of one of the most ancient and valiant families of Lorraine.
Phillippe Chabot, a renowned captain in the reign of Francis I.,

wielded the staff of power from 1516 to 1543. The illustrious
family of Montmorency appear as Knights Templars,
and Henry, the first Duke, was the chief of the Order
from the year 1574 to 1614. At the close of the seventeenth
century, the Grand Master was James Henry de Duras, a
marshal of France, the nephew of Turenne, and one of the
most skilful soldiers of Louis XIV. The Grand Masters
from 1724 to 1776 were three princes of the royal Bourbon
family. The names and years of power of these royal personages
who acknowledged the dignity of the Order of the
Temple, were Louis Augustus Bourbon, Duke of Maine,
1724-1737,&mdash;Louis Henry Bourbon Conde, 1737-1741,&mdash;and
Louis Francis Bourbon Conty, 1741-1746. The successor
of these princes in the Grand Mastership of the Temple
was Louis Hercules Timoleon, Duke de Cosse Brissac, the
descendant of an ancient family long celebrated in French
history for its loyalty and gallant bearing. He accepted the
office in 1776, and sustained it till he died in the cause of
royalty at the beginning of the French Revolution. The
Order has now at its head Sir William Sidney Smith, of
chivalric renown, who became Regent upon the death of
the late Grand Master, Bernard Raymond Fabré Palaprat.
The high and heroic character of Sir Sidney Smith,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
whose deeds of arms at St. Jean d'Acre, rivalling those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of the Royal Crusader, Richard I, obtained for him by
Eastern Nations the appellation of the modern "C&#339;ur de
Lion,"&mdash;specially pointed him out as the most worthy of
Christian Knights to fill this eminent station. He who with
such noble philanthropy founded and presided over the Society
of Knights Liberators of the White Slaves in Africa,
cannot but shed additional lustre on the Soldiery of the
Temple, whose professed object originally was, and yet is,
the protection of defenceless pilgrims, and the rescuing of
Christians from Infidel bondage. Under such a Chief the
Order must prosper, and there are now Colleges or Establishments
in England and in many of the principal Cities of Europe.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Thus the very ancient and sovereign Order of the
Temple is in full and chivalric existence, like those Orders of
Knighthood which were either formed in imitation of it, or
had their origin in the same noble principles of chivalry. It
has mourned as well as flourished, but there is in its nature
and constitution a principle of vitality which has carried it
through all the storms of fate; its continuance, by representatives
as well as by title, is as indisputable a fact as the
existence of any other chivalric fraternity. The Templars
of these days claim no titular rank, yet their station is so far
identified with that of the other Orders of Knighthood, that
they assert equal purity of descent from the same bright
source of chivalry; nor is it possible to impugn the legitimate
claims to honourable estimation, which the modern
brethren of the Temple derive from the antiquity and pristine
lustre of their Order, without at the same time shaking
to its centre the whole venerable fabric of knightly honour.</p>

<p class="indent">After this short account of the continuation of
the Order, which we have extracted from Mill's Chivalry, it may be
interesting to describe the present nature and objects of the
Institution; and we shall accordingly make a brief abstract
of the statutes established by the Convent-General held at
Versailles in 1705, under the Grand Mastership of the
Regent Duke of Orleans, and by succeeding General Convocations,
so far as they relate to these subjects. The
Order of the Fellow Soldiers of the Temple consists of two
distinct classes, termed a Superior and Inferior Militia; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
former comprising all Knights consecrated according to rites,
rules, and usages, with their Esquires; and the latter, the
humbler brethren or persons admitted <i>propter artem</i>, and
the candidates, or as they are designated, the <i>postulants</i> for
the honours of Chivalry. Except as a serving brother,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
no one is eligible even to the lower grade, who is not of
distinguished rank in society, which in Great Britain is
understood to imply that station in life which would entitle a
gentleman to attend the Court of his Sovereign. The Candidate
must moreover be strongly recommended by Sponsors
as a Christian of liberal education, eminent for virtue, morals,
and good breeding, and in no case is a scrutiny into these
qualifications dispensed with, unless the aspirant be a Knight
of Christ, a Teutonic Knight, or the descendant of a Knight
Templar. Should he be ambitious of the rank of Novice
Esquire, which usually precedes Knighthood, he is farther
called on to produce proofs of nobility in the fourth generation;
and a deficiency in this requisite can only be supplied
by a formal decree of the Grand Master, conferring on
him the nobility necessary for his reception. Considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fees are paid by all entrants; and members, on being promoted
to the equestrian honours of the Order, are expected
to make an oblation to the Treasury, the amount of which
cannot be less than four drams of gold,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
but generally very far exceeds that sum. Before receiving the vow of profession,
which is still administered to all Chevaliers,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the Candidate makes a solemn declaration either that he does not
belong to the Order of Malta,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
or that he abjures the spirit of rival hostility which actuated the Knights
of St. John in former days against the Templars. These preliminaries
being arranged, his petition is finally decided on, either in a
Conventual house, or by the special legate of the Grand
Master, in whose name only his reception can be proclaimed,
and once armed a Knight, and consecrated a Chevalier of
the Temple, he cannot on any pretence whatever renounce
the Order.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">At the head of the Hierarchy of the Order, ranks
the Convent-General, or assembly of the Knights, but the executive
power is vested in the Grand Master, whose authority
is almost unbounded. He is elected for life from among the
Knights, and it is declared impious to substitute a successor
to him unless he be deceased, or shall have voluntarily abdicated;
he may even nominate his successor by testament or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
otherwise to the Convent-General. He can create new
houses and dignities on the Order, cancelling those already
constituted, remit penalties, and confer all benefices and
offices, the collation to which is not specially provided for in
the statutes. He confirms all Diplomas of profession and
patents of appointment, and may send legates possessing
powers delegated by himself to different countries. His
interpretation of the laws is valid, even against a statute of
the Convent-General, and he alone has the power of proposing
alterations in the rules to that assembly.</p>

<p class="indent">Next in honour to the Grand Master, unless he has
publicly appointed a delegate or successor, are his four Deputes,
or <i>Vicarii Magistrales</i>, who are nominated by himself, and
removable at his pleasure. After these follow the Members
of the Grand Council, which consists of the Supreme Preceptor,
and eight Grand Preceptors, the Primate of the
Order, and his four Coadjutors General, with all the Grand
Priors, Ministers, and other principal dignitaries that may
be present at the Magisterial City. Each nation of the
Order is presided over by its Grand Prior, appointed for life,
whose language comprises the various subordinate divisions
of Bailiwicks or Provinces; Commanderies; Convents of
Knights and Noviciate Esquires; Abbeys of Ladies and
Canonesses; Chapters of Postulants, and Conclaves of Initiation.
Except in special cases, no Chevalier is eligible
for a Commandery before the expiration of two years from
his having obtained the honours of knighthood, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
like manner no Commander can be appointed a Bailli, nor
any Bailli a Grand Prior, before the same period has intervened.</p>

<p class="indent">In order that the objects of the Institution may
be distinctly understood, we shall now proceed to translate a
decree by the present Grand Master, bearing date the 4th
September 1826, in explanation of the Vow of Profession
which has been already referred to, observing, at the same
time, that the Order of the Temple, being exclusively devoted
to the Christian religion, cannot be considered in the
slightest degree connected with Free Masonry, which, it is
well known, welcomes equally to its bosom the Jew and the
Gentile, the Christian and the Mahommedan, requiring from
each only a belief in a Divine Being, with a just sense of
moral rectitude and conscientious obligation.</p>

<p class="indent">The decree alluded to states, that as the Vow
contains many <i>dispositions</i> which, misconstructed, might
appear incompatible with the advance of knowledge and manners of
the age, it is declared that Candidates sign it under the following
interpretation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent blockquot"><i>1st</i>, That by the Vow of Poverty, the Order
does not mean to submit the Chevaliers to an absolute poverty, but
to remind them that they ought always to be ready to share
their fortune with the unfortunate, and to sacrifice it for the
wants of the Order.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent blockquot"><i>2d</i>, That the vow of chastity, and of abhorring
lewdness, is the solemn engagement of fulfilling the obligation that
society imposes on all men to labour to overcome their vicious
propensities, in order not to outrage either decency or morality.</p>

<p class="indent blockquot"><i>3d</i>, That the obedience due to the Grand Master,
and to the dignitaries of the Order, does not exclude the duty imposed
on every chevalier of conforming himself, as a man, to
natural right, and of obeying, as a citizen, the government of
his country.</p>

<p class="indent blockquot"><i>4th</i>, Lastly, That the Templars are not actuated
by the desire of material conquests,&mdash;that their principal aim is
not to recover the dominions of which the Order was despoiled,
or the earth which received the body of Jesus the Christ,
but to reconquer to the doctrine for which was precipitated
into the tomb that divine preceptor of men,&mdash;the empire
which it always had over the people when it was revealed to
them in all its purity,&mdash;in a word, that the Templars are not
ambitious of subduing the physical universe to their domination,
but the nations that cover it to Christian morality.</p>

<p class="indent">It has frequently been asserted, that the Templars
have always professed a religion peculiar to themselves, and much
at variance with almost every religious creed at present in
existence, but on this subject it is only necessary to say here,
that although they possess many religious documents of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
extraordinary nature, and, amongst others, a very ancient
Greek manuscript of <i>Evangile</i> and the Epistle of St. John,
differing from the version contained in the vulgate, yet no
chevalier is obliged to subscribe to them unless he be a candidate
for certain offices in the Order. This subject is fully
explained in a work lately published at Paris, "Recherches
Historiques sur les Templiers et sur leurs Croyances Religieuses
par J. Plivard, officier superieur d'Artillerie;" and, for the
present, we are unwilling to enter upon it, not having as yet
received the <i>proces verbal</i> of the Convent-General of the
Order, lately assembled at Paris, to which the following
question, under the authority of the Grand Master, was submitted:&mdash;"L'ordre
etant Cosmopolite, et d'après le veu de
profession dans la Chevalerie, est il convenable de laisser subsister
dans les statuts des dispositions par lesquelles certains
officiers de l'Ordre ne pouvent être choisis que parmis les
Chevaliers professant la religion Johannite?"</p>

<p class="indent">The habit of the Order<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
consists, as formerly, of the white tunic and mantle, with the red cross on
the left breast; a white cap with a red feather; a white silk sash fringed
with red; white pantaloons, buff-boots, gold spurs and an equestrian
sword with a silver hilt. The dress differs somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
according to the rank of the individual, but every Chevalier
is bound to wear the gold ring of profession, with the Cross
of the Order, and the letters, P. D. E. P.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
together with his own name, and the date of his reception engraven
thereon. Each Knight also is decorated with the conventual cross or
jewel of the Order, which consists of a gold cross of eight
points enamelled white, surmounted by the Grand Master's
crown, and bearing on its centre a cross pattee enamelled gules.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">In concluding these observations, we regret
to say that the Order of the Temple, notwithstanding its undeniable claims
to honourable distinction, has never enjoyed much consideration
amongst our countrymen. Its exclusive character, together
with the great expense and difficulty which attend
admission into its ranks, no Englishman being legitimately
eligible, unless formally recommended by the illustrious
Grand Prior of England, has raised against it a host of enemies.
Hence, calumnies have been propagated against it,
and an institution perfectly unconnected with politics, and
actuated by the purest principles of Christian Philanthropy,
<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
has been represented as engendering false notions of Government
and wild infidelity. But the registers of the Temple
contain the respected names of Massillon and Fenelon; Frederick
the Great, and Napoleon<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
sanctioned its ceremonies, and honoured its officers; and even in these days, princes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
blood, and some of the most illustrious nobles, of our own and
other countries, have not disdained to display the humble
ring of profession, along with the gorgeous decorations of
the Garter and the Golden Fleece. Scattered over the
mighty empire of Great Britain, there are not more than
forty subjects of Her Majesty who are Knights Templars;
and the whole Members of the Order do not probably at this
moment exceed three hundred; but we assert, without fear
of contradiction, that no institution equally limited can boast
of a greater number of distinguished and honourable associates.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">The Knights of the Temple were introduced
into Scotland before 1153 by King David the First, who established
them at Temple on the Southesk,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and who was so attached to the brotherhood,
that we are told by an old historian "Sanctus
David de pr&#339;clara Militia Templi optimos fratres secum retinens,
eos diebus et noctibus morum suorum fecit esse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
custodes."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Malcolm, the grandson of David, conferred on the
brethren "in liberam et puram Elymosynam unum plenarium
Toftum in quolibet Burgo totius terræ," which foundation
was enlarged by his successors, William the Lion and Alexander
the Second. The charter of the latter is still in the
possession of Lord Torphichen, whereby he grants and confirms
"Deo et fratribus Templi Salomonis de Jerusalem
omnes illas rectitudines, libertatis et consuetudines quas Rex
<span class="smcap">David</span> et Rex Malcolm et decessus pater meus Rex Willielmus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
eis dederunt et concesserunt, sicut scripta eorum authentica
attestant." This curious document, after enumerating
certain of these rights and liberties, scilicet,&mdash;the king's sure
peace; the privilege of buying, selling, and trading with all
his subjects; freedom from all tribute and toll, &amp;c. proceeds
"Et nullus eis injuriam faciat, vel fieri consentiat super
meam defensionem, Et ubicunque in tota terra mea ad judiorum
(<i>q. judicium</i>) venerint, causa eorum primum tractata,
et prius rectum suum habeant, et postea faciant. Et
nullus ponat hominem predictorum fratrum nostrorum ad
foram judicii si noluerint, &amp;c. Et omnes libertates et consuetudines
quas ipsi per alias regiones habent in terra mea ubique habeant."</p>

<p class="indent">These general privileges, throughout Europe, were
very extensive. The Templars were freed from all tythes to the
church, and their priests were entitled to celebrate mass, and
to absolve from sins to the same extent as bishops, a privilege
which was strongly objected to by the latter. Their houses
possessed the right of sanctuary or asylum for criminals.
They could be witnesses in their own cause, and were exempted
from giving testimony in the cause of others. They
were relieved by the papal bulls from all taxes, and from
subjection and obedience to any secular power. By these great
immunities, the Order was rendered in a manner independent,
but it would appear, nevertheless, that both the Templars
and Hospitallers considered themselves subjects of the countries
to which they belonged, and took part in the national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
wars, for we find by the Ragman Roll, "Freere Johan de
Sautre, Mestre de la Chevalier del Temple en Ecoce," and
another Brother, swearing fealty to Edward I. in 1296; and
the author of the Annals of Scotland, taking notice of the
Battle of Falkirk, 12th July 1298, informs us, that the only
persons of note who fell were Brian le Jay, Master of the
English Templars, and the Prior of Torphichen in Scotland,
a Knight of another Order of religious soldiery. The former
of these Chevaliers met his death by the hand of the redoubted
Sir William Wallace, who advanced alone from the midst
of his little band, and slew him with a single blow, although
the historian adds, that Sir Brian le Jay was a Knight Templar
of high military renown, who had shewn himself most
active against the Scots.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Little is known of the farther History of the
Knights Templars in Scotland from the time of Alexander II. down
to the beginning of the 14th century, excepting that their
privileges were continued to them by succeeding Kings,
whose bounty and piety were in those ages continually directed
towards the religious Orders. By their endowments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and the bequests of the nobles, the possessions of the Order
came to be so extensive, that their lands were scattered "per
totum regnum Scotiæ, a limitibus versus Angliam, et sic discendo
per totum regnum usque ad Orchades." Besides the
House of the Temple in Mid-Lothian, the following Establishments
or Priories of the Order may be enumerated, viz.
St. Germains, in East Lothian; Inchynan, in Renfrewshire;
Maryculter, in Kincardineshire; Aggerstone, in Stirlingshire;
Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire; Derville or Derval, in
Ayrshire; Dinwoodie, in Dumfriesshire; Red-abbey-stedd,
in Roxburghshire, and Temple Liston, in West-Lothian.</p>

<p class="indent">The date of the spoliation of the Templars of
Scotland, corresponds of course with that of the persecution of the
Order in other countries, and it is to the credit of our forefathers
that we can obtain no account of any Member of the
Brotherhood having been subjected to personal torture or
suffering amongst them; their estates, however, appear to
have been duly transferred to the possession of their rivals,
the Knights Hospitallers; into which Order it is not improbable
that, like their Brethren in England, a number of the
Templars entered.</p>

<p class="indent">In November 1309, John de Soleure, the Papal
Legate, and William, Bishop of St. Andrews, held an Inquisitorial
Court at the Abbey of Holyrood to investigate the charges
against the Templars, but Walter de Clifton, Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Preceptor of the Order in North Britain,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and William de Middleton, were the only two Knights who appeared before
the Tribunal, the proceedings of which, as recorded at length in
Wilkins' Consilia, make no allusion to any punishment being
inflicted, so that we may fairly conclude they were soon set
at liberty. The Preceptor, in his examination, readily confessed
that the rest of the Brethren had fled, and dispersed
themselves <i>propter scandalium exortum contra ordinem</i>,
and we are told by a learned French writer, that having
deserted the Temple, they had ranged themselves under the
banners of Robert Bruce, by whom they were formed into a
new Order, the observances of which were based on those of
the Templars, and became, according to him, the source of
Scottish Free Masonry.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
This statement corresponds with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the celebrated Charter of Larmenius already referred to, in
which the Scottish Templars are excommunicated as <i>Templi
desertores, anathemate percussos</i>; and along with the
Knights of St. John, <i>dominiorum Militiæ spoliatores</i>, placed
for ever beyond the pale of the Temple, <i>extra gyrum Templi
nunc, et in futurum</i>; and it is likewise supported in
some measure by the authority of the accurate historian of
Free Masonry, M. Thory, who, in his "Acta Latomorum,"
states that Robert Bruce founded the Masonic Order of Heredom
de Kilwinning, after the Battle of Bannockburn, reserving
to himself and his successors on the Throne of Scotland,
the office and title of Grand Master. Scottish tradition has,
moreover, always been in favour of this origin of the Ancient
Mother Kilwinning Lodge, which certainly at one time possessed
other degrees of Masonry besides those of St. John;
and it is well known to our Masonic readers, that there are
even in our own days at Edinburgh, a few individuals claiming
to be the representatives of the Royal Order established by
Bruce, which, though now nearly extinct in this country,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
still flourishes in France, where it was established by Charter
from Scotland, and even by the Pretender himself, in the
course of last century, and is now conferred as the highest
and most distinguished grade of Masonry, sanctioned by the
Grand Orient, under the title of the <i>Rose Croix de Heredom
de Kilwinning</i>. It may be interesting to add, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
introduction on the Continent of this ancient branch of our
national Masonry, has been commemorated by a splendid
medal struck at Paris, bearing, amongst other devices, the
Royal Arms and Motto of Scotland; and that the Brethren
of the Lodge of Constancy at Arras, still preserve with
reverence an original charter of the Order, granted to their
Chapter in 1747, by Charles Edward Stuart, and signed by
that unfortunate Prince himself as the representative of the
Scottish Kings.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Nor can any thing indicate more strongly
the high estimation in which the chivalry of the Rosy Cross
of Kilwinning is held in France, than the fact that the
Prince Cambaceres, Arch-chancellor of the Empire, presided
over it as Provincial Grand Master, (the office of supreme
head being inherent in the Crown of Scotland,) for many
years; and that he was succeeded in his dignity, if we mistake
not, by the head of the illustrious family of Choiseul.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">But whether the Scottish Templars really joined
the victorious standard of Robert Bruce, and with him, as our
countrymen would fain hope, fought and conquered at Bannockburn,
or whether the majority of them transferred themselves
along with the possessions of the Order, to the Knights
of St. John of Jerusalem, certain it is, that from the time of
the persecution, the Order of the Temple, together with all
its wealth, became merged in that of the Hospitallers, though
certainly not to such a degree as to obliterate all distinct
traces of the Red Cross Knights. On the contrary, we find
by a public document recorded entire in the Register of the
Great Seal of Scotland, and dated <i>two centuries</i> after the
incorporation of the Orders, that King James the Fourth
confirmed all former grants <i>sancto Hospitali de Jerusalem,
et fratribus ejusdem militiæ Templi Salomonis</i>,&mdash;a satisfactory
proof that the Order, although proscribed by the
Pope, was still retained conjointly with that of the Hospital,
in law papers at least.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Knights of St. John had also been introduced
into Scotland by King David the First, and had a charter granted
to them by Alexander the Second, two years after that to the
Templars. The Preceptory of Torphichen, in West Lothian,
was their first, and continued to be their chief residence, and
by the accession of the Temple lands and other additions,
their property at the time of the Reformation came to be
immense. When that event took place, the chief dignitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
or Grand Preceptor of the Order in Scotland, with a seat as
a Peer in Parliament, was Sir James Sandilands, a cadet of
the family of Calder, whose head, as is well known to readers
of Scottish History, was the private friend of John Knox,
and one of the first persons of distinction to embrace the reformed
religion. We might suspect, that even before the
promulgation of the statute 1560, prohibiting all allegiance
within the realm to the See of Rome, the former personage
had become indifferent to the charge confided to him by the
Order; for a rescript from the Grand Master and Chapter
at Malta, dated so early as the 1st of October 1557, and
addressed to him, is still on record, wherein they complain
"that many of the possessions, jurisdictions, &amp;c. were conveyed
or taken away from them contrary to the statutes and
oaths, and to the damnation of the souls, as well of those who
possessed them, as of those who, without sufficient authority,
yielded them up; producing thereby great detriment to religion
and the said Commandery;" but be this as it may, we
are certain that the conversion of Sir James Sandilands, or
as he was termed, the Lord of St. John of Jerusalem in Scotland,
was followed by his surrender to the Crown of the
whole possessions of the combined Templars and Hospitallers,
which having been declared forfeited to the State on the
ground that "the principal cause of the foundation of the
Preceptory of Torphichen, <i>Fratribus Hospitalis Hierosolimitani,
Militibus Templi Salomonis</i>, was the service enjoined
to the Preceptor on oath to defend and advance the
Roman Catholic Religion," were by a process of transformation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
well understood by the Scottish Parliament of those days,
converted into a Temporal Lordship, which the unfortunate
Queen Mary, then only twenty years of age, and newly established
amongst her Scottish subjects, in consideration of a
payment of ten thousand crowns of the Sun, and of his <i>fidele,
nobile, et gratuitum, servitium, nobis nostrisque patri et
matri bonæ memoriæ</i>, conferred on, or rather retransferred
to the Ex Grand Preceptor himself and his heirs with the
title of Torphichen, which, although the estate is much dilapidated,
still remains in his family.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
All this was transacted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
acted on the petition of Sir James Sandilands himself, with
the formal approbation of the National Legislature; and after
renouncing the profession of a soldier-monk, we find that the
last of Scottish Preceptors of St. John became married and
lived to a good old age, having died so late as 1596 without
issue, when the title of Torphichen passed to his grand
nephew, the lineal descendant of his elder brother, Sir John
Sandilands of Calder.</p>

<p class="indent">We shall not pause to consider whether a body of
Masonic Templars unconnected with the Hospitallers, and representing
the Royal Order which Bruce is said to have instituted
from the relict of the Ancient Knights, has been perpetuated
in Scotland since the days of Bannockburn, having no means
of illustrating so obscure a subject; but, with all due respect
to the learned French writer, whose authority we have already
quoted, we may observe, that the Masonic Tradition of the
country does not connect the Templars with Bruce's Order
in any way whatever, but, on the contrary, invariably conjoins
those Knights with the Hospitallers, and consequently points
to the period of the renunciation of Popery, as the time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
they first sought refuge, and a continuance of their Chivalry
among the "Brethren of the Mystic Tie." The Chevaliers
also of the Rosy Cross of Kilwinning in France, own no
alliance with Masonic Templary, which they consider a comparatively
modern invention; nor do there exist, so far as
we know, any authentic records anterior to the Reformation,
to prove a connection between the Knights Templars and
Freemasons in any part of the world, though we must not
omit to mention, that a formal document in the Latin language
is said to be deposited in a Lodge at Namur on the Meuse,
purporting to be a proclamation by the Freemasons of Europe,
"of the Venerable Society sacred to John," assembled by
representatives from London, Edinburgh, Vienna, Amsterdam,
Paris, Madrid, Venice, Brussels, and almost every other
Capital City, at Cologne on the Rhine in 1535; and signed,
amongst others, by the famous Melancthon, in which, after
declaring that "to be more effectually vilified and devoted
to public execration, they had been accused of reviving the
Order of the Templars," they solemnly affirm, that "the
Freemasons of St. John derive not their origin from the
Templars, nor from any other Order of Knights; neither
have they any, or the least communication with them directly,
or through any manner of intermediate tie, being far more
ancient," &amp;c.&mdash;all of which would imply, that some sort of
connection was understood in those days to exist between
certain of the Masonic Fraternities and the Knights Templars.
A Copy of this document was sent to Edinburgh in
1826, by M. de Marchot, an Advocate at Nivelles, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
translation of it has been inserted under the attestation of a
Notary Public in the Records of the Ancient Lodge of
Edinburgh, (Mary's Chapel); but we have little faith in
German documents on Free Masonry, unless supported by
other testimony; and as no Historian of the Craft makes the
slightest allusion to the great Convocation of the Brethren at
Cologne, in the sixteenth century, rather than ask the reader
to believe that it ever took place, we shall presume that
M. de Marchot may have been deceived.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="indent">From the era of the Reformation, the combined
Order appears in Scotland only as a Masonic body; but there are some
records to indicate that, so early as 1590, a few of the brethren
had become mingled with the Architectural Fraternities, and
that a Lodge at Stirling, patronised by King James, had a
Chapter of Templars attached to it, who were termed cross-legged
Masons; and whose initiatory ceremonies were performed
not in a room, but in the Old Abbey, the ruins of which
are still to be seen in the neighbourhood. The next authentic
notice we can find on this subject, is in M. Thory's excellent
Chronology of Masonry, wherein it is recorded, that about
1728, Sir John Mitchell Ramsay, the well-known author of
Cyrus, appeared in London, with a system of Scottish Masonry,
up to that date, perfectly unknown in the metropolis,
tracing its origin from the Crusades, and consisting of three
degrees, the <i>Ecossais</i>, the <i>Novice</i>, and the <i>Knight Templar</i>.
The English Grand Lodge rejected the system of Ramsay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
who, as is well known, along with the other adherents of the
Stuart Family, transferred it to the Continent, where it became
the corner-stone of the <i>hauts grades</i>, and the foundation
of those innumerable ramifications into which an excellent and
naturally simple institution has been very uselessly extended
in France, Germany, and other countries abroad.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In pursuing the very curious subject of the
<i>hauts grades</i>, we may observe, however, that they never obtained
much consideration during the lifetime of Ramsay, although they
are invariably traced to him and to Scotland, the fairy land of
Foreign Masonry,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
but gathered their chief impulse from the
disgraceful dissentions in the Masonic Lodges at Paris, about
the middle of last century, which induced the Chevalier de
Bonneville, and other distinguished persons at the Court of
France, to form themselves into a separate institution, named
the Chapitre de Clermont, in honour of one of the Princes of
the Blood, Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Clermont, then presiding
over the Masonic Fraternities. In this Chapter they
established, amongst other degrees, Ramsay's system of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Masonic Templars, which, along with other high grades, was
soon conveyed into the Northern Kingdoms of Europe, by
the Officers of the French Army, but especially, by the Marquis
de Bernez, and the Baron de Hund, the latter of whom
made it the ground-work of his Templar <i>Regime de la Stricte
Observance</i>, which occupied, for several years, so prominent a
place in the Secret Societies of Germany. This adventurer
appeared in that country with a patent, under the sign-manual
of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, appointing him Grand
Master of the seventh province; but although he had invented
a plausible tale in support of his title and authority,&mdash;both
of which he affirmed had been made over to him by the Earl
Marischal on his death-bed,&mdash;and of the antiquity of his order,
which he derived, of course, from Scotland, where the chief
seat of the Templars was Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
&mdash;the imposture was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
soon detected, and it was even discovered that he had himself
enticed and initiated the ill-fated Pretender into his fabulous
order of Chivalry. The delusions on this subject,
however, had taken such a hold in Germany, that they were
not altogether dispelled, until a deputation had actually visited
Aberdeen, and found amongst the worthy and astonished
brethren there, no trace either of very ancient Templars or
Freemasonry.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
From some of the Continental States, it is
conjectured that Masonic Templary was transplanted into
England and Ireland, in both of which countries it has continued
to draw a languid existence, unconnected with any
remnant of the Knights of St. John, whose incorporation in
the Scottish Order, is one of the most remarkable features of
that Institution. We are happy to add, nevertheless, that
the most fraternal feelings and intercourse subsist between
the Scottish brethren and the Templars of the sister kingdoms,
and we can ourselves testify to the cordiality with which the
former are received in the encampments of London.</p>

<p class="indent">During the whole of the eighteenth century the
combined Order of the Temple and Hospital in Scotland can be but
faintly traced, though I have the assurance of well-informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Masons that thirty or forty years ago they knew old men who
had been members of it for sixty years, and it had sunk so low
at the time of the French Revolution, that the sentence which
the Grand Lodge of Scotland fulminated in 1792 against all
degrees of Masonry except those of St. John, was expected to
put a period to its existence. Soon after this, however, some
active individuals revived it, and with the view of obtaining
documentary authority for their chapters, as well as of avoiding
any infringement of the statutes then recently enacted
against secret societies, adopted the precaution of accepting
charters of constitution from a body of Masonic Templars,
named the Early Grand Encampment, in Dublin, of whose
origin we can find no account, and whose legitimacy, to say
the least, was quite as questionable as their own. Several
charters of this description were granted to different Lodges
of Templars in Scotland about the beginning of the present
century, but these bodies maintained little concert or intercourse
with each other, and were certainly not much esteemed
in the country. Affairs were in this state when, about 1808,
Mr. Alexander Deuchar was elected Commander, or Chief
of the Edinburgh Encampment of Templars, and his brother,
Major David Deuchar, along with other Officers of the Royal
Regiment, was initiated into the Order. This infusion of
persons of higher station and better information gave an immediate
impulse to the Institution, and a General Convocation
of all the Templars of Scotland, by representatives, having
taken place at the Capital, they unanimously resolved to
discard the Irish Charters, and to rest their claims, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
representatives of the Knights of old, on the general belief of
the country in their favour, and the well-accredited traditions
handed down from their forefathers. They further determined
to entreat the Duke of Kent, who was a Chevalier du
Temple, as well as the chief of the Masonic Templars in England,
to become the Patron Protector of the Order in North
Britain, offering to submit themselves to His Royal Highness
in that capacity, and to accept from him a formal Charter
of Constitution, erecting them into a regular Conclave of
Knights Templars, and Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.
The Duke of Kent lost no time in complying with their request,
and his Charter bears date 19th of June 1811. By a
provision in it, Mr. Deuchar, who had been nominated by
the Brethren, was appointed Grand Master for life.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">These wise and vigorous measures rescued the Order
from obscurity; and in its improved condition, we find that it
continued rapidly to flourish, numbering, in the course of a
few years, no less than forty encampments or lodges in different
parts of the British dominions holding of its Conclave.
In 1828, the Order seemed to have received a fresh impulse,
and assumed a novel and interesting aspect by the judicious introduction
of the ancient chivalric costume and forms. Dissentions,
however, unfortunately occurred, from 1830 to 1835,
tending to impede the further progress of the Order; and for a
while it may be said to have again almost fallen into abeyance.
In the end of the latter year, a committee of ten gentlemen was
appointed to settle all differences, as well as to frame proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
regulations for the future government of the Order. Under
their arrangement and arbitration, the present statutes were
established, and a reconciliation effected between the contending
parties. In January 1836, Admiral Sir David Milne,
K. C. B. was unanimously elected Grand Master, and at a
general election in the same month, Lord Ramsay (now
Earl of Dalhousie) was appointed his Depute, the various
other offices in the Order being filled by gentlemen, generally
well known, and of a respectable station in society. In
the course of three months after the re-union, not fewer than
a hundred persons, chiefly men of fortune, officers, and members
of the learned professions, had been received into the
Order in the Edinburgh Canongate Kilwinning Priory or
Encampment alone. Since then, other Priories have been established
in the country, and the Institution has assumed an
importance and dignity worthy of the highest class of gentlemen
connected with the Masonic Institutions of Scotland.</p>

<h2>DISCOURS DE L'AMIRAL SIR SIDNEY SMITH,<br />
<small>AU CONVENT GENERAL LE 27 JANVIER 1837.</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><i>S. A. le Lieutenant-Général d'Asie</i> demande la parole.
Ce vénérable frère s'exprime ainsi qu'il suit.</p>

<p class="indent">"Sérénisme Grand-Maître, et vous tous mes nobles frères:</p>

<p class="indent">"Justement et infiniment sensible à l'honneur qui m'a été conféré,
par suite de ma nomination, à la haute dignité de Lieutenant-Général d'Asie, je dois
vous en témoigner toute ma reconnaissance.</p>

<p class="indent">"A mon âge avancé, je puis prétendre à être considéré comme exempt
d'ambition: je vois par conséquent dans cet acte de la haute confiance du Grand-Maître,
une charge onéreuse et un lourd fardeau, plutôt qu'un avantage:
mais, je l'accepte avec respect. Mes soins et mes efforts constans seront
toujours employés pour prouver que je n'ai pas fait en vain le serment de
fidélité et de soumission à l'ordre et à son chef suprême.</p>

<p class="indent">"Je vois dans cette nomination une preuve de la vraie libéralité du
Grand-Maître éclairé de cet ordre, essentiellement cosmopolite, où toutes les nations
chrétiennes se confondent et co-opèrent ensemble pour le maintien de la paix
du monde et de l'harmonie entre les sectes religieuses, par la tolérance, la
charité et la protection pour les pélerins en Terre Sainte, contre les pirates et
brigands; premier but de sa fondation, qui précéda les autres ordres de la
chevalerie moderne, ordres qui <i>n'ont été</i> et ne <i>sont</i> que ses <i>imitateurs</i>:
car le notre ne demande que l'occasion de remplir son devoir sacré. Aussi est-ce
avec une vive satisfaction que je vois enfin un Grand-Maître apprécier l'importance
de l'ordre, <i>et pour la premiére fois, appeler pour un de ses lieutenans, je
ne dis pas un anglais, mais un templier de la langue d'Angleterre</i>. <i>Honneur
au Grand-Maître qui a fait un tel acte, et qui montre ainsi à toutes les nations,
que toutes ont des droits égaux à remplir les diverses charges du Temple</i>:
Honneur à ce chef qui a si longtemps et si loyalement conservé le feu sacré,
et les traditions, malgré les orages et les persécutions, suite d'une révolution
dont l'origine remonte pour nous, a <i>Philippe-le-Bel</i> et au <i>Pape Clement V.</i>
Mais espérons qu'enfin nous rentrerons dans tous nos droits; et qu'au lieu de
dresser la tente magistrale dans une langue excentrique, un jour nous la dresserons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
au lieu de notre crèation, dans la ville qui nous appartient, dans la
<i>sainte Jérusalem</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Honneur aux très nobles chevaliers qui se sont montrés penétrés
du sentiment de leurs devoirs, et ont donné constamment des preuves qu'ils sont
incapables d'oublier leur serment de fidélité et d'obéissance!......</i></p>

<p class="indent">"J'ai déjà communiqué verbalement à S. A. E., devant témoins, ce
que j'ai consigné dans mon testament, la disposition formelle, pour la restitution
au chef du Temple, d'une croix de l'ordre qui est très ancienne, à en juger par
sa forme et la monture des pierres, laquelle croix a appartenu à un de ses Grand-Maîtres,
et fut du temps des croisades portée dans la guerre sainte par le roi
d'Angleterre <i>Richard</i> I<sup>er</sup>, dit <i>C&#339;ur-de-Lion</i>. Ce roi l'a laissée
en dépôt entre les mains de l'archevêque de Chypre lors de son départ de cette ile, dont
il était Souverain par conquête. J'ai été personnellement décoré de cette
croix en 1799, par les mains du dixhuitième archevêque, successeur du dépositaire,
qui l'a plaçé sur ma poitrine, en reconnaissance de la réussite de mes
efforts, pour rétablir la paix et la protection due à la population chrétienne de
l'île, contre l'insurrection des troupes Asiatiques qui avaient assassiné leur
chef, appelé le <i>Patrona Bey</i>, et commençaient déjà à se livrer au pillage et au
massacre des habitans: désastres que j'ai empêchés par ma présence au milieu
de ces furieux, sans armes, le firman du Sultan <i>Selim</i> en main, et par la nomination
d'un successeur <i>a Patrona Bey</i>, en vertu de l'autorité supréme qui
m'avait été déléguée dans le temps par la Porte Ottomane, sur les forces
combinées de terre et de mer dans le Levant.</p>

<p class="indent">"L'autorité qui maintenant m'est déléguée par le sérénissime grand-maitre
sur le continent d'Asie, pourra en temps et lieu être employée utilement pour
protéger la population chrétienne de ces contrées, et le maintien de la hiérarchie
de l'ordre. Croyez, que pour la plus grande gloire du Temple, je me
ferai un devoir d'employer l'influence que les antécédens m'ont donnée. <i>Les
templiers fidèles peuvent compter sur moi.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Le grand-maitre exprime au lieutenant-général d'Asie, les sentimens
dont lui et ses frères sont animés pour un Chevalier qui a conquis l'admiration du monde
par ses hauts faits maritimes, et a mérité par ses vertus sociales et templières,
l'estime et l'affection de tous ses frères. Le grand-maitre lui donne au nom de
l'ordre l'accolade fraternelle.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Convent Général ordonne que le discours de l'Amiral
<i>Sir Sidney Smith</i> soit inséré textuellement au procès-verbal.

<p class="blockquot">The following account from the pen of the learned
Biographer of the gallant Admiral, of the Investiture of Sir Sidney
Smith, as a Knight Commander of the Bath, by his
contemporary and brother in arms, the great and illustrious
Wellington, and the "very extraordinary" document
which follows, will, no doubt, be read with much interest:</p>

<p class="indent">Towards the termination of this year, 1815, our officer
was honoured, in a most particular manner, by his Sovereign.</p>

<p class="indent">His Grace the Duke of Wellington having received
the gracious commands of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent
of the United Kingdoms, through his Royal Highness the Duke
of York, Grand-master of the most honourable order of the
Bath, to invest Vice-Admiral Sir William Sidney Smith,
Knight-commander-grand-cross of the Royal Military Order of
the Sword, with the insignia of commander of the aforesaid, his
Grace fixed on the 29th of December for the performance of
the ceremony, which took place accordingly at the Palace
Elisée-Bourbon, the Knights-grand-crosses, Knights-commanders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
and Companions being present, as also his Grace the
Duke of Richmond and the Right Honourable the Earl of
Hardwick, both Knights of the most noble Order of the Garter.</p>

<p class="indent">At six o'clock the Commander elect arrived at the
palace, and being conducted and supported into the presence of the
noble Duke representing the Sovereign on the occasion, by the
two junior grand-crosses, Sir James Kempt and Sir Henry
Colville, after the usual reverences in advancing, (the Commander
elect being already a Knight, the usual ceremony of
dubbing him as such was formally dispensed with,) his Grace
proceeded, according to the order of his Royal Highness the
Grand-Master, which he first read, and invested the Commander
with the insignia of the Order: after which his Grace embraced
Sir Sidney Smith twice most cordially, with every
demonstration of the feelings of esteem and regard, feelings
which the Knights, Grand-crosses, and Commanders, many of
whom had served in Egypt as his juniors in rank, also testified;
and it certainly may be said to be a proud day for England
when such a scene took place in the evacuated palace of
Buonaparte, between these two British officers of the two
services, one of whom first checked, and the other of whom
finally closed, the career of that ambitious chieftain.</p>

<p class="indent">The banquet being announced, his Grace desired
his Excellency the British ambassador, Sir Charles Stuart, G.C.B.,
to conduct the new Knight Commander to the hall of the same,
where the members of the Order, including some foreigners
of distinction, amongst whom were Don Michael Alava,
General Muffling, and Count Demetrius Valsamachi, a nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
of the Ionian Islands, were entertained most sumptuously
in the usual style of the Duke's elegant hospitality.</p>

<p class="indent">After the health of the King and Prince Regent
had been drunk, the Duke gave the health of "Sir Sidney Smith:"
the company hereupon rose, and followed his Grace's example
in greeting the new Commander with the most cordial acclamations.
When silence was restored, Sir Sidney Smith
rose, and addressed the company nearly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"My Lords, noble Knights, Grand Crosses, Commanders,
and Companions!&mdash;I should not do justice to my feelings,
were I not to endeavour to express them in returning you
my thanks for the honour you have done me by this reception:
at the same time, I feel I cannot do justice to them by
any mode of expression I can make use of.</p>

<p class="indent">"The language of <i>compliment</i> must die on the
lips of any man in the presence of the Duke of Wellington; first, from
the inadequacy of all language to express what every man
must feel when speaking of such a highly distinguished chief;
next, from the recollection of the noble simplicity of his character
which disdains it. It will, I trust, be readily believed,
that I must be most truly gratified to be invested by a knight
of such high renown and glorious achievements; and the
more so in this <i>particular place</i>, and in an assembly of so
many illustrious and highly distinguished Knights-Commanders
and Companions. A combination of circumstances, which
could only happen in the present times, and are mainly owing
to the successful result of the battle of Waterloo. Noble
and illustrious Knights, I beg you to accept the expression of
my humble thanks for the honour you have done me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Duke of Wellington having acceded to Sir Sidney
Smith's request to be allowed to propose a toast to the company,
he proceeded to say&mdash;"I beg leave to call to remembrance
that this day (the 29th of December) is the anniversary
of a re-union of illustrious knights of various orders,
which took place at Vienna, where many Sovereigns were
present, and when the toast I shall have the honour to propose
to you was drunk by them with a manifestation of their
conviction, that the object of it intimately concerned knighthood
as such, in all nations. I beg leave to propose the
health and deliverance of the <i>white Slaves in the Barbary
States</i>."</p>

<p class="indent">The toast was received with the most marked approbation,
and drunk with the usual demonstrations thereof, by three
times three regular and hearty cheers, when the company
adjourned to the ball-room, preceded, on the indication of
the Duke of Wellington, by the new Knight-Commander,
supported by his Britannic Majesty's ambassador, in the
same order as on entrance, where a brilliant assembly of
ladies, English, French, Spanish, Russian, &amp;c. &amp;c. continued
to increase till a late hour; his Royal Highness the Duke
of Berry, the French, and the foreign ministers, were also
present, and all joined in cordial congratulations of, and
compliments to, the cosmopolite chieftain, President of the
Knights Liberators of the white slaves in Africa; who, we
observed, was decorated with the various orders of the nations
he has contributed by his endeavours to release from the
yoke of the former inhabitants of the palace where this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
extraordinary assembly was held; then a prisoner on the top
of a rock in the Southern Atlantic. These circumstances reminded
the Parisians of the prophetic inscriptions left by
Sidney Smith on the window shutter of the Temple prison,
when he escaped, of which many copies were taken and are
now again in circulation, and read with great interest since
the accomplishment has taken place: we have been favoured
with a translation, of which we give our readers a copy, the
original having been in French, and respected by various
successive guardians of the tower, till the Prince de Rohan,
afterwards Duke de Rohan, subsequently a prisoner in that
tower, removed it for its preservation, and we are assured he
now possesses it.</p>

<h3>"SIDNEY SMITH TO BUONAPARTE."</h3>

<p class="indent">"Fortune's wheel makes strange revolutions, it
must be confessed; but for the term revolution to be applicable,
the term should be a complete one, for a half turn is not a

your fortunate situation, for I am better off than you; I am
as low in the career of ambition as a man can descend; so
that let fortune turn her wheel ever so little, and as she is
capricious, turn it she will, I must necessarily mount, and
you as necessarily must descend. I do not make this remark
to you to cause you any chagrin; on the contrary, with the
intent to bring you the same consolation I have at present

the same point; you will inhabit this prison, why not as
well as I? I did not think of such a thing any more than
you do at present, before I found myself brought hither.
In party wars 'tis a crime in the eyes of opponents for a man
to do his duty well; you do yours now, and consequently
you by so much irritate your enemies; you will answer me.</p>

<p class="indent">"'I fear not their combined hatred, the voice
of the people is declared for me, I serve them well:' that is
all very good talking; sleep in quiet, you'll very soon learn
what one gains by serving such a master, whose inconstancy
will perhaps punish you <i>for all the good</i> you do him.
'Whoever,' (says an ancient author, Pausanias Atticus,)
'puts his entire confidence in public favour, never passes his

course, treat you as well as he does me."</p>

Parisian papers in 1799, and having been put into Buonaparte's hands at

<p class="indent">After this display of his country's gratitude to
Sir Sidney Smith, which became so much the more enhanced, as it may
be said to have taken place almost in the presence of so many
Sovereigns, Sir Sidney had little else to do but to enjoy his
richly-merited rewards, the universal admiration, and the
approbation of his own mind, ever active in doing good, not
only for his country, but for the whole human race.</p>

<p class="indent">He prosecuted with ardour his plans for the abolition
of white slavery, even after the destruction of the pirates' nest in Algiers.</p>

<h2>DEATH AND FUNERAL</h2>
<p class="large"><b>OF</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: center;"><b>ADMIRAL SIR WILLIAM SIDNEY SMITH, G.C.B.</b></p>

<p class="larger"><b>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</b></p>

<p class="indent space-above">Sir William Sidney Smith died on Friday
Morning, the 26th May 1840, at his residence, No. 9, Rue d'Aguisseau,
in the 76th year of his age. Honoured by his Sovereign, and
decorated with the Orders of almost every State in Europe,
he was, in private life, beloved and respected by all who had
the pleasure of his friendship or acquaintance. His chivalrous
and lofty bearing, his cheerful and animated conversation,
his unbounded fund of anecdote, suavity of temper, and
invariable benevolence, rendered him a most welcome and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
instructive companion.&mdash;It has been truly written by his
Biographer,</p>

<p class="indent">"Than Sir Sidney Smith, no one ever inscribed
on the pages of History, and even of Romance, more emphatically
deserved the title of Hero."</p>

<p class="indent">The mortal remains of this Gallant and Illustrious
Admiral were interred, May 29, in the Cimetiére de l' Est,
or Eastern Division of the Great Cemetery of Pére la Chaise.
The body was taken from his late residence in the Rue
d'Aguisseau to the English Episcopal Church in the same
street, followed by his relatives, William and Herbert Smith,
Esquires, Nephews, Captain Arabin, and &mdash;&mdash; St. Clair,
Esquire, Sons-in-law of the deceased, with Vice Admiral Sir
Charles Rowley, Bart. Lieut.-General Lord Aylmer, General
Count Excelmans, Peer of France, and the French
Admiral Bergeret, as supporters of the Pall, besides many of
the principal English residents in Paris, among whom were
several officers of high rank in the British Navy.&mdash;The introductory
part of the service was performed in the Church by
the Right Reverend Bishop Luscombe, and two assistants,
and the body was then borne to the Cemetery, attended by a
long cortége of mourning and private carriages. On the
Coffin was placed the Hat, Sword, and Uniform of the deceased,
and on a cushion his epaulettes and numerous orders.
Over the foot of the coffin was spread the British Union
Jack. At the conclusion of the burial service, which was
most impressively read by Bishop Luscombe, three orations
were delivered&mdash;the first by Monsieur Jullien, of Paris, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
gave a short but comprehensive recapitulation of the services
of Sir Sidney, from his first entering the British Navy at the
age of 13, and also expatiated largely on his amiable and
philanthrophic qualities. The next speaker, M. Caille, Advocate
of the Cour Royale of Paris, after pronouncing a general
panegyric on the character of the deceased as a warrior, proceeded
to eulogise him for his active and generous exertion
in promoting the objects of several philanthropic societies
of which he was a member, and to which his advice, his
practical and scientific acquirements, and his inventions,
were so invaluable. Both speakers were loud in their praise
of Sir Sidney, for his having been almost the first to interfere
for the suppression of European slavery in Africa, and for his
indefatigable and strenuous exertions in that humane cause.
The third gentleman, M. Raoul, Advocat of the Court of Cassation,
spoke in a similar strain of eulogium of the character
of Sir Sidney as a citizen of the world, ever ready to aid the
cause of humanity. No stronger testimony to his worth
could, however, have been shewn, than to hear his eulogium
pronounced solely by members of a Nation against which,
in his career of arms, he had so successfully and gloriously
fought. Sir Sidney Smith was Prince Magistral and Regent
of the Order of the Temple, and a Member of the Legion
of Honour.</p>

<p class="indent">The following two Discourses pronounced upon the
melancholy occasion, were, in the kindest and most handsome manner,
contributed by M. Jullien, the learned author of many valuable works.&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"><b>AUX FUNERAILLES DE</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: center;"><b>L'AMIRAL SIR SIDNEY SMITH,</b></p>
<p class="big"><b>PAR M. JULLIEN, DE PARIS,</b></p>

<p class="blockquot space-above">Son ancien ami et son Collègue, comme membre et
président honoraire de plusieurs Sociétés Savantes ou Philantropiques, le 29 Mai 1840.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messieurs</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">L'homme respectable auquel nous venons adresser un dernier adieu,
ne fut pas seulement un marin et un guerrier célèbre; il fut surtout un ami constant,
dévoué et chevaleresque de l'humanité. Dans sa longue et aventureuse carrière
qu'il a parcourue avec tant d'éclat, il s'est moins distingué encore par sa brillante
valeur que par une loyauté et une générosité qui lui ont conquis les coeurs,
même de ses ennemis. Né a Londres le 21 Juin 1764, entré au Service en
1777, avant l'âge de 13 ans, comme simple novice (élève de marine,) a bord
d'une frégate stationnée sur les côtes de l'Amérique, pendant la guerre de
l'indépendance, il passa, en 1779, sur le Sandwich, vaisseau de 90 canons, sur
lequel l'Amiral Sir <span class="smcap">George Bridges Rodney</span> arbora son pavillon
de Commandement-en-Chef, et fit voile, le jour de noël de cette même année, pour
Gibraltar, et ensuite pour les Indes Occidentales, <span class="smcap">Sidney Smith</span>
fut successivement Lieutenant de vaisseau et Capitaine de corvette. Il prit part à tous
les combats qui eurent lieu dans cet hémisphère jusqu'à la paix de 1783.</p>

<p class="indent">En 1788, Sidney Smith passa en Suède, alors en guerre avec la Russie,
ostensiblement comme volontaire auxiliaire, mais en réalité comme Aide-de-Camp
honoraire et intime du roi Gustave III. Après avoir rendu, en cette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
qualité, les plus brillant et les plus utiles services à la Suède, il reçut des mains
mêmes de ce monarque chevaleresque, la décoration de première classe de
l'ordre de l'epée. A cette époque, ces distinctions honorifiques n'étaient point
prodiguées et prostituées, comme elles l'ont été depuis, et elles avaient un véritable
prix, n'étant accordées qu'au mérite et aux services réels.</p>

<p class="indent">En 1793, le jeune Smith se rendit comme volontaire en Turquie, où il
conduisit avec lui plusieurs constructeurs de vaisseaux. Peu après, il était chargé
d'un commandement dans la Croisière Anglaise sur les côtes de France. Le 18
Avril 1796, ayant abordé un vaisseau Français à la hauteur du Ilaîre, obligé
par le courant de remonter la Seine, il fut fait prisonnier par des forces supérieures
qui l'attaquérent; puis amené à Paris, ou il resta deux ans dans le
prisons de l'Abbaye et du Temple. Echappé de sa prison par l'intervention
d'amis dévoués, il rejoignit la flotte Anglaise en 1798. La même année, appellé
à commander les forces auxiliaires que La Grande-Bretagne mettaìt à la disposition
de la Turquie, où son frère Sir <span class="smcap">Spencer Smith</span>, était Ministre
Plénipotentiaire, auprès de là Porte Ottomane, il se trouve le 1 Mars 1799, jusqu'au
20 Mai suivant, au siège mémorable de Saint Jean d'Acre, et co-opère puissamment
à la défense de cette place.</p>

<p class="indent">Nous ne devons, en présence d'un cercueil, rappeler que des souvenirs
compatibles avec notre unanime sympathie pour notre illustre ami, Bornons-nous
à dire que Sidney Smith se montra grand et magnanime envers les Français faits
prisonniers; il sut les garantir, par son énergique volonté, des violences et de
la barbarie Turques; il mérita leur estime et leur affection; et la loyautè Française
aime à reconnâitre que sa conduite, lors même qu'il était l'allié de nos
ennemis, fut noble et généreuse envers ceux que le sort des armes mettait en sa
puissance. Les généraux Kleber et Desaix, qui entrèrent en négociation avec
lui après le départ de Bonaparte, ont apprécié sa droiture et son humanité, et
lui ont rendu justice.</p>

<p class="indent">Sidney Smith, après avoir sauvé la vie de nos compatriotes, rendit intactes
aux savans de l'expédition les caisses contenant les papiers et les cartes qui devaient
servir à écrire l'histoire de la campagne d'Egypte. Aussi, à la paix le
gouvernement Français, sur la proposition de la commission de l'institut Egyptien
lui a offert un exemplaire de ce magnifique ouvrage, comme un témoignage
de la reconnaissance publique.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Pg_xxxv"></a>[Pg xxxv]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Après les événemens d'Egypte es de Syrée, où Sidney Smith avait
contribué à ménager à l'armée Française des conditions honorables pour revenir
dans sa patrie, il quitta lui-même les parages de l'Orient, et se rendit en Angleterre
où il fut élu membre de la Chambre des Communes, par la ville de Rochester, en 1802.</p>

<p class="indent">Nous le voyons reparaître, en 1803, avec un commandement sur les côtes
de la France et de la Hollande. En 1807, il commande la flotte chargée de défendre
la Sicile. En 1806, il est envoyé à Constantinople où il force les Dardanelles, au
mois d'Octobre 1807, il commande les forces Anglaises mises à la disposition
du Portugal; et le 29 Novembre suivant, une partée de sa flotte accompagne au
Bresil la famille royale, qui va chercher au-delà des mers un asyle dans ses
possessions Americaines.</p>

<p class="indent">Dans ses relations avec les Rois et avec les princes souverains, comme
avec les peuples et dans tous les pays où le conduisit sa destinée aventureuse, Sidney
Smith contracta d'honorables et d'illustres amitiés. Ce fut principalement en
1814, au Congrès de Vienne, qu'il fixa l'attention de tous les grands personnages
réunie alors pour poster les vases de la Paix Européenne, et qu'il reçut de tous
sans exception les hommages, d'une estime respectueuse. Il conçut alors la
pensée philantroprique de fonder, avec le concours des Monarques alliés, et de
tous les hommes de bien qui partageaient ses vues, une <i>institution anti-pirate</i>, en
<i>association des chevaliers libérateurs des esclaves blancs et noirs en Afrique</i>. Car,
il avait souvent déploré, dans ses commandement sur les différens points de la
Mediterranée, les actes cruels de la piraterie barbaresque, trop longtems tolérée
par les puissances Chrétiennes, et il s'était promis d'y mettre un terme. Plus
de cent noms illustres remplirent les listes de souscription qu'il avait ouvertes.
Il entretint, pendant plusieurs années, une vaste et active correspondance, au
moyen de laquelle il contribua puissamment à faire cesser les malheurs d'un
grand nombre de victimes, des actes de piraterie qui jusqu'alors s'étaient commis
impunément et presque librement sous les yeux de l'Europe civilisée.</p>

<p class="indent">Pendant les 25 années de paix générale qui ont précédé sa mort,
le grand homme de guerre que nous pleurons aujourd'hui se montra constamment homme
pacifique et bienfaisant, véritable cosmopolite, ami sincère de l'humanité, en
prenent ce mot dans sa plus complète acception.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
Par une singularité nouvelle de sa destinée, Sidney-Smith meurt en France,
où il reçoit les regrets et les hommages de ses compatriotes, et de ses concitoyens
d'adoption, au moment même où l'Angleterre, sa patrie, restitue à la France
les cendres de Napoléon. La nation Anglaise paie un tribute d'admiration à ce
même Empereur qu'elle n'a cessé de combattre pendant sa vie. La terre Française
reçoit les dépouilles mortelles de l'Amiral Britannique qui employa longtems
contre elle ses talens et son courage, qui depuis a consacré 25 années à servir, au
milieu des Français et avec leur co-opération, la cause sacrée de l'humanité et
celle du malheur.</p>

<p class="indent space-below">Au nombre des titre de gloire de l'Amiral, nous ne devons pas omettre
la louable persévérance avec laquelle il s'est occupé de perfectionner les moyens de
sauvetage et sa grande part à la fondation de la socièté générale des naufrages,
qui a donné un plus grand dèveloppement à ses vues bienfaisantes. Ainsi les
passions humaines s'éteignent en présence d'un tombeau. Ainsi les nations abjurent
de cruelles et injustes antipathies qui les ont trop longtemps divisées.
Ainsi tous les hommes de bien, quelle que soit leur terre natale, se réunissent
pour honorer l'homme qui, par ses vertus et ses actions, a servi avec dévouement
les grands intérêts de la famille humaine.</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"><b>AMIRAL DE LA FLOTTE ROUGE D'ANGLETERRE,</b></p>

<p class="center">Lors de ses obsèques, dans le cimetière de l'Est, à Paris, le 29 Mai 1840,</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: center;"><b>PAR M. CAILLE,</b></p>

<p class="center">Avocat à la Cour Royale de Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messieurs</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">Invité depuis quelques instans seulement, par la famille de l'Amiral William
Sidney Smith, á exprimer de justes regrets sur sa tombe, je ne puis apporter qu'un
bien faible tribut d'admiration à sa mémoire, surtout après l'éloge que vient
de prononcer au nom de l'Ordre du Temple, dont cet illustre Anglais était le
régent, l'un des dignitaires de cet ordre, et lorsqu'une notice historique de sa
vie vous a été présentée par l'un des litterateurs les plus distingués de la France.</p>

<p class="indent">L'histoire transmettra à la postérité les exploits du célèbre marin,
de l'habile négociateur, du généreux philanthrope, dont nous déplorons la perte. C'est
exclusivement sous le rapport moral et philosophique que j'essaierai de vous retracer
quelques épisodes de sa carrière entièrement consacrée au bonheur de ses
semblables, et l'influence politique qu'il exerça sur les états, avec lesquels il fut
mis en rapport par son gouvernement.</p>

<p class="indent">Sidney-Smith, comme vous le savez, comptait déjà dix-huit années de
services militaires distingués, lorsque, à l'âge de trente-quatre ans, il fut chargé
par le ministère Anglais, en qualité de commodore, de la station maritime de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
l'Archipel du Levant, en 1798; c'est-à-dire à l'époque de la conquête de
l'Egypte, par l'armée de la république Française, sous les ordres du général
Bonaparte.</p>

<p class="indent">Je ne vous peindrai pas sa lutte héroïque avec le géant du siècle,
à Saint-Jean-d'Acre, dont il fit lever le siège après soixante jours de tranchée: je me
hâte de vous signaler un service qui devait être incalculable dans ses conséquences
politiques, et que Sidney-Smith rendit à la sublime Porte, dont il
releva le courage par ses succès: il sut profiter du crédit obtenu par sa victoire
de Saint-Jean-d'Acre, auprès du sultan Selim III, et de Kléber, général de
l'armée Française en Egypte, depuis le retour de Bonaparte en France, pour
négocier le fameux traité d'El-Arich, du 24 janvier 1801, traité qu'il considérait
comme le préliminaire de la paix entre les puissances belligérantes. Il y
stipula que l'armée française évacuerait l'Egypte, avec armes et bagages, et
serait transportée en France.</p>

<p class="indent">Sidney-Smith signa ce traité avec les pleins pouvoirs du ministère
Britannique, dont il était revêtu: le grand-visir et le général Kléber le signèrent,
au nom de leurs gouvernemens respectifs.</p>

<p class="indent">Je ne puis trop insister, messieurs, sur cette époque où Sidney-Smith arbora
l'olive de la paix entre trois camps ennemis; il avait prévu les nouvelles destinnées
de la France, et sa haute sagesse avait préféré de traiter avec elle, dans
l'intérêt de la Sublime Porte, et de gouvernement Britannique lui-même, et
surtout dans l'intérêt de l'humanité, plutôt que de courir la chance faillible des
combats.</p>

<p class="indent">Mais le ministère Anglais, qui ne lui avait donné qu'à regret des
pouvoirs et des instructions pacifiques, informé que l'armée du grand visir était forte
de 80,000 hommes, tandis que celle de Kléber ne l'était que de 8000, crut l'occasion
favorable d'anéantir la puissance Française en Egypte, il refusa de ratifier le
traité d'El-Arich, et osa donner l'ordre à l'amiral Keith d'exiger que l'armée
Française mît bas les armes et se rendît prisonnière de guerre. Sidney-Smith
fut profondément affligé de cette violation des lois de la guerre et du droit des
gens.</p>

<p class="indent">Dés-lors les hostilités recommencèrent. L'armée Française combattit
avec ce sentiment de l'indignation qui décuple le courage: elle défit entièrement l'armée
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
ottomane á Héliopolis. Le grand-visir, qui la commandait, ne dut son salut
qu'à la fuite, en laissant aux vainqueurs ses bagages, et un immense butin.</p>

<p class="indent">Ce ne fut q'une année après cette victoire que l'Egypte fut rendue
aux Turcs, par le traité d'Amiens, de 1802; tandis qu'ils l'auraient recouvrée, sans de
nouvelles pertes, dès 1801, si le traité de Sidney-Smith eût été ratifié, comme
il aurait dû l'être, puisqu'il n'avait fait que se conformer strictement aux
instructions de son gouvernement.</p>

<p class="indent">Vous connaissez, messieurs, la brillante réception qui fut faite à
Londres, à Sidney-Smith, lors de son retour dans sa patrie, en 1802; il y fut accueilli
avec le plus grand enthusiasme; le surnom de <i>Dieu marin</i> lui fut décerné par
le peuple. La ville de Rochester s'empressa de l'élire pour son représentant au
Parlement, où il siéga dans les rangs de l'opposition, entre Shéridan et Fox.</p>

<p class="indent">J'appellerai votre attention sur un autre genre de services rendus à
la nation Ottomane, par Sidney-Smith. Pendant son séjour à Constantinople, il avait
acquis une grande influence sur Mahmoud-Kan II, qui, en 1808, succéda au sultan
Mustapha IV, son frère. Sidney-Smith, par ses conseils, a puissamment contribué
aux importantes révolutions politiques que Mahmoud-Kan II a introduites
dans ses états, et notamment à la charte constitutionnelle que sous le titre de
Hatti-Shériff de Gulaneh, cet immortel sultan a donnée au peuple Ottoman,
charte dont le vice-roi d'Egypte, Méhémet-Ali, vient d'ordonner l'application,
pour la révision de l'horrible procès intenté, dans la ville de Damas, par le fanatisme
de secte, contre d'honorables Juifs, faussement accusés du meurtre d'un
prêtre catholique.</p>

<p class="indent">Il est un plus grand service encore rendu a l'humanité, et auquel
Sidney-Smith a eu la gloire de participer très-activement, c'est l'abolition de l'esclavage,
dans toutes les colonies de la Grande-Bretagne. Grâce a l'ascendant irrésistible
de l'opinion publique, les gouvernemens de l'Europe seront forcés d'imiter ce
sublime exemple, et de proscrire irrévocablement cet abominable trafic d'hommes,
arrachés a leur patrie, pour être vendus, comme un vil bétail.</p>

<p class="indent">Je ne dois pas oublier que, dès l'année 1817, Sidney-Smith infatigable
dans son dévouement a l'humanité, avait établi, a Londres et a Paris, une association
anti-pirate, dont l'objet était de faire cesser la traite des blancs, exercée impunément,
en présence de l'Europe civilisée, par les corsaires d'Alger, de Maroc et de Tunis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Dans les dernières années d'une vie illustrée par tant d'actes mémorables,
Sidney-Smith s'occupa de la recherche des moyens de sauvetage, pour les navires
exposés aux tempêtes de la mer. Il a eu l'honneur d'être dans cette découverte
l'un des inventeurs qui out le plus approché de la solution du problème
de la garantie contre les naufrages.</p>

<p class="indent">Telle a été, messieurs, la carrière de Sidney-Smith, promu successivement à
tous les grades de la marine, et jusqu' à celui d'Amiral de la Flotte Rouge d'Angleterre,
que lui conféra le roi Guillaume IV; il a été de plus décoré de tous les ordres des souverains
de l'Europe, en reconnaissance des nombreux services qu'il leur a rendus.</p>

<p class="indent">A la vue du triste cercueil, qui contient les restes de Sidney-Smith,
nous bornerons-nous au stérile récit de ses nobles actions? Non, messieurs. Le vénérable
évêque de l'église Anglicane, qui préside avec tant de dignité, à ces funérailles,
vient d'invoquer, dans sa prière, le texte de l'Evangile, sur l'immortalité de
l'âme, qu'il me soit permis d'ajouter à cette révélation du Christianisme, que les
progrès de la science out démontré cette vérité, sans lui faire rien perdre du
charme de l'espérance.</p>

<p class="indent">En effet, dans ce cercueil, que la tombe n'a point encore dérobé à nos
regards, que reste-t-il? Des débris d'organes inanimés. Mais ces nerfs, cette membrane
qui les enveloppa, cette pulpe cérébrale qui les pénétra, qu'étaient-ils? de la
matière! Ah! de ces organes matériels, à la Sensation, il y a un abîme! Et de la
Sensation à la Pensée, un nouvel abîme! Elle est donc immatérielle, cette Pensée,
qui distingue si éminemment notre espèce, des autres êtres organisés!</p>

<p class="indent">N'est-ce pas la Pensée qui créa les arts et les sciences, qui, s'élevant
jusqu'à la cause première, terme de ses conquêtes, y découvrit la Divinité, dont elle
établit le culte universel, comme le plus puissant mobile de la civilisation?</p>

<p class="indent">Combien n'est-il pas consolant, au milieu des parens et des nombreux
amis qui entourent cette tombe, d'y professer, d'y confirmer le dogme de l'immortalité
de l'âme, et de pouvoir y proclamer que Sidney-Smith n'est pas mort tout entier?</p>

<p class="indent">Oui, messieurs, le principe intellectuel qui nous anime, est incontestablement
un être, et cet être est immortel. Pourrait-il donc s'anéantir, quand les organes
matériels de nos corps sont eux-mêmes éternels dans leurs élémens?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">L'orateur qui vient de retracer avec tant de talent, la carrière de
l'illustre Amiral, vous a signalé la restitution des cendres de l'empereur Napoleon a la
France, par le gouvernement Britannique, comme un gage de la parfaite harmonie,
heureusement rétablie entre les deux nations. Je partage ce favourable
augure, et tel fut le v&#339;u le plus intime de Sidney-Smith, qui ne cessa de
répéter que la civilisation du monde tenait essentiellement à l'alliance de la
France et de l'Angleterre.</p>

<p class="indent">A l'aspect des restes de Napoléon, traversant l'Océan pour recouvrer
un tombeau dans sa patrie, j'aime à prévoir que les restes de Sidney-Smith seront
pareillement réclamés par son gouvernement, et qu'à leur tour, ils traverseront

<h2>SKETCH</h2>
<p style="font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"><b> OF THE</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: center;"><b>HISTORY AND POSSESSIONS OF THE ORDER</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: center;"><b>IN IRELAND.</b></p>

<p class="indent space-above">The Order of Knights Templars was introduced
into Ireland about the year 1174, by Richard, surnamed Strongbow,
Earl of Pembroke, or Strigul. A Priory was founded by him in that
year, under the invocation of St. John the Baptist, at Kilmainham,
in the County of Dublin, for Knights Templars, (see Archdall's
Monasticon Hibernicum, pages 222 et seq.) and King Henry
II. granted his confirmation. Hugh de Cloghall was the first
Prior, and enjoyed that office till about the year 1190. The
noble founder had enfeoffed the Prior in the whole lands of Kilmainham;
and dying in 1176, was interred in Christ Church.
The two Orders of Knights Templars and Hospitallers were confirmed
the same year. After this, Hugh Tirrel bestowed upon
the Prior of this hospital the lands of Chapel-Izod and Kilmehanock,
"free from all secular services and burthens, with all liberties
and free customs, in wood and open country, in meadows
and pastures, in roads and paths," &amp;c. &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Kilmainham continued to be the Grand Priory or Preceptory
of the Templars, till their suppression in 1312; and the Superior
of the Order, according to Sir James Ware, sat in the House of
Peers as a Baron, a privilege enjoyed, as regarded the military
orders, only by the Grand Priors of Kilmainham for the Templars,
and of Wexford for the Hospitallers. He is styled by Archdall,
quoting different ancient records, sometimes <i>Prior</i>, and sometimes
<i>Master</i>, as in the case of Maurice de Prendergast, 1205 and 1210;
sometimes <i>Preceptor</i>, as "D. Walens, Preceptor of the Templars,
1247;" sometimes <i>Grand Master</i>, as "1266, Robert was Grand
Master of the Templars in Ireland this year." In 1288, we find
"William Fitz-Roger was <i>Prior</i> this year, and Thomas de Thoulouse
<i>Master</i> of the Templars;" in 1296, "Walter le Bachelour
was <i>Master</i>, and William de Rosse was <i>Prior</i>, who the same
year was made Lord Deputy of Ireland." He continued in these
offices till 1302, when he was made Chief Justice; and appears
in this year also to have preferred his complaint against the sheriff
of Dublin for an illegal seizure, as "the <i>Master</i> of the Templars."
And in 1309, Gerald, son of Maurice, Lord of Kerry, is spoken
of as "the last <i>Grand Prior</i> of the Order."</p>

<p class="indent">The subordinate governors of the Order appear to
have been styled indiscriminately Preceptors or Commanders; and
their castles or estates Preceptories or Commanderies. These
were (according to Ware and Archdall) at Clontarf, in the
county of Dublin, founded in Henry II.'s reign, as it is supposed
by the Nettervilles; St. Sepulchre, in the city of Dublin
or its suburbs, near the place where the Archbishop's
palace stands; Kilsaran, in the county of Louth, founded in
the 12th century by Maud de Lacie; Kilbarry and Killure, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
one about a mile and a half from Waterford, and the other two
miles east of that city, in the county of the same name, both
founded in the 12th century, the founders unknown; Crooke, in
the harbour of Waterford, four miles east of the city, founded in
the 13th century, by the Baron of Curragmore; Clonaul, in
Tipperary, as also one at Thurles, in the same county, where a
castle now standing was, according to the tradition of the country,
for no record exists, the castle of the Knights Templars; Teach-Temple,
or Temple House, in the county of Sligo, founded in
the time of Henry III.; Mourne, in the county of Cork, founded
in the reign of King John, by Alexander de Sancta Helena;
Killergy, or Killarge, in the county of Carlow, "founded in the
reign of King John, by Gilbert de Borard, for Knights Templars,
under the invocation of St. John the Baptist; Kilclogan, in the
county of Wexford, founded in the 13th century by the family
of O'More, which appears to have had a large estate attached to it,
from the report made in the thirty-second year of King Henry
VIII., quoted by Archdall, page 748; and Dundrum, in the
county of Down, where is a strong castle, now in ruins, said to
have been built by Sir John de Courcy."</p>

<p class="indent">All these Commanderies and Preceptories were,
together with the Grand Priory of Kilmainham, granted on the abolition
of the Order, to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, in whose
possession they continued till the dissolution of monasteries in
the reign of King Henry VIII.</p>

<p class="indent">It may not be uninteresting to add the account of
Archdall regarding the circumstances which attended the persecution
and attempted destruction of the Order <i>in Ireland</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"In 1307, Walter de Ewias, or de Aqua, being Prior,
the King (Edward II.) transmitted to John Wogan, Justiciary of
Ireland, the order made for the suppression of the Knights
Templars in England, on the Wednesday after the feast of the
Epiphany, enjoining him to have it executed in Ireland without
delay, and before the rumour of what was done in England could
reach this kingdom. The mandate was accordingly obeyed, and
on the morrow of the Purification the Templars were everywhere
seized."</p>

<p class="indent">"1309. The King, by writ, dated September the 29th,
did further command the said Justiciary to apprehend, without
delay, all the Templars that had not yet been seized, and them
safely to keep in the Castle of Dublin, together with those who
had been before apprehended."</p>

<p class="indent">"1311. On the petition of Henry Danet, or De Tanet,
the late Master of the Templars, and the other members of that
Order, the King, by writ, dated December 4th, did grant for
their support the manors of Kilclogan, Crooke, and Kilbarry."</p>

<p class="indent">"1312. This year, on the morrow of St. Lucia the Virgin,
the moon appeared variously coloured, on which day it was finally
determined that the Order of Knights Templars should be totally abolished."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent space-below">"The trial of the Templars was conducted with great
solemnity in the city of Dublin, before Friar Richard Balybyn, minister
of the Order of the Dominicans in Ireland, Friar Philip de
Slane, lecturer of the same, and Friar Hugh St. Leger. Amongst
other witnesses against the Knights, were Roger de Heton,
Guardian of the Franciscan Friars; Walter de Prendergast, their
lecturer; Thomas, the Abbot; Simon, the Prior of the Abbey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
of St. Thomas-the-Martyr, and Roger, Prior of the Augustinian
Friary in Dublin. The depositions against the Templars were
weakly supported, yet they were condemned; but more indeed
through blind compliance with the prevailing practice throughout
other parts of Europe, than any demerits being proved against
their persons. Their lands and possessions of every kind were
bestowed upon the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem by the
Pope, which grant was confirmed by the King, who at the same
time entered a protest of his rights against the assumed power of
the Pope."</p>

<h2>S. M. G. D. O.</h2>

<p class="indent space-above">We, the Elect Masters of the Venerable Society
sacred to John, or of the Social Order of Freemasons, Rulers of
the Lodges or Tabernacles, constituted at London, Edinburgh,
Vienna, Amsterdam, Paris, Lyons, Frankfort, Hamburgh,
Antwerp, Rotterdam, Madrid, Venice, Ghent, Regiomonte,
Brussels, Dantzic, Middleburgh, &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and
in the City of Cologne, in Chapter assembled in the said City of
Cologne, in the year, month, and days aftermentioned. Our
Preses being the Master of the Lodge established in this
City,&mdash;a venerable Brother and most learned, prudent, and
judicious man, called to preside over these deliberations, by
our unanimous vote;&mdash;do, by these letters addressed to all
the above-mentioned Lodges,&mdash;to our Brethren present and
future, declare, that forasmuch as we have been considering
the designs, which in these calamitous times embroiled,
by Civil dissensions and discord, have been imputed to our
foresaid Society, and to all the Brethren belonging to this
Order of Freemasons, or of John, opinions, machinations,
secret, as well as openly detected; all which are utterly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
foreign to us, and to the Spirit, Design, and Precepts, of the
Association. It moreover appears that we, the Members of
this Order, (chiefly because we are bound by those inscrutable
secrets of our connection and covenant which are most sacredly
kept by us all,) in order that we may be more effectually
vilified among the uninitiated and profane, and that
we may be devoted to public execration, are accused of the
crime of reviving the Order of the Templars, and commonly
designated by that appellation, as if we had combined and
conspired for the purpose of recovering, as Members of that
Order, its property and possessions, and avenging the death
of the last Grand Master, who presided over that Order, on
the posterity of the Kings and Princes who were guilty of
the crime, and who were the authors of the extinction of
said Order; as if, with that view, we were exciting schisms
in the Churches, and disturbance and sedition in the Temporal
Government and Dominions; as if we were influenced
by hatred and enmity against the Pope, the Chief Pontiff, the
Emperor, and all Kings; as if obeying no external power, but
only the superiors and elected of our own Association, which
is spread throughout the whole World,&mdash;we executed their secret
mandates and clandestine designs, by the private intercourse
of correspondence and emissaries; as if, in fine, we admitted
none into our Mysteries but those who, after being
scrutinised and tried by bodily tortures, became bound and devoted
to our Conclaves. <span class="smcap">Therefore</span>, having all
these considerations in view, it hath seemed to us expedient, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
absolutely necessary, to expound the true state and origin of
our Order, and to what it tends, as an institute of charity itself,
according as these principles are recognised and approved
by those who are most versant in the Highest Craft, and by
masters enlightened in the genuine sciences of the Institution,
and to give forth to the Lodges or Conclaves of our society the
principles thus expounded, digested, and organised, as an examplar
authenticated by our signatures, whereby a perpetual
record may remain of this our renewed covenant, and
the unshaken integrity of our purpose; and also in case,
through the daily increasing propensity of the people to animosities,
enmity, intolerance, and wars, this our society
should hereafter be more and more oppressed, inasmuch
as to be unable to maintain its standing and consolidation,
and thus be dispersed to some distant regions of the
earth; and in case, through lapse of time, the society itself
should become less observant of its integrity, purity, and
incorruptibility, nevertheless, in better times and more convenient
circumstances, there may remain, if not the whole,
yet perhaps one or other of the duplicates of these presents,
by which standard the Order, if subverted, may be restored,
and if corrupted or estranged from its purpose and designs,
may be reformed. For <span class="smcap">THESE CAUSES</span>, by these
our universal letters, compiled according to the context of the
most ancient monuments which are extant, concerning the
objects of the institution,&mdash;the rites and customs of our
most ancient and most secret order,&mdash;We, Elect Masters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
influenced by the love of the true light, do, by the most
solemn sanctions, adjure all fellow-labourers, to whom these
presents now or in time hereafter may come, that they withdraw
not themselves from the truth contained in this document.
<span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, to the enlightened, as well as to the
darker world, whose common safety concerns and strongly
interests us, we announce and proclaim,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Alpha;)</b> That the Society of Free Masons, or
Order of Brethren attached to the solemnities of St. John, derive
not their origin from the Knights Templars, nor from any other order
of knights, ecclesiastic or secular, detached or connected with
one or more, neither have any or the least communication
with them, directly, or through any manner of intermediate
tie; that they are more ancient than any order of knights of
this description, and existed in Palestine and Greece, as well
as in every part of the Roman Empire, long before the Holy
Wars, and the times of the expeditions of the above mentioned
knights into Palestine.</p>

<p class="indent">That from various monuments of approved authenticity,
the fact is to us quite notorious, that this our Association
took its origin from the time when first on account of the
various Sects of the Christian World, a few adepts distinguished
by their life, their moral doctrine, and their sacred
interpretation of the Arcanic Truths, withdrew themselves
from the multitude; for the learned and enlightened men,
who lived in those times, (the true Christians who were least
infected with the errors of Paganism,) when they considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
that through a corrupt religion, schisms, and not peace, and
neither toleration nor charity, but atrocious wars, were promulgated,
bound themselves by a most solemn Oath, in order
more effectually to preserve uncontaminated the Moral
Principles of this Religion, which are implanted in the mind
of man, that to these they would devote themselves; that the
True Light, arising gradually out of darkness, might proceed
to the subduing of superstitions, by the cultivation of
every Human virtue, and to the establishment of peace and
comfort among men. That under these benign auspices the
Masters of this community are called Brethren dedicated to
John, following the example and invitation of John the Baptist,
Precursor of the Rising Light,&mdash;first among the Martyr
Stars of the Morning.</p>

<p class="indent">That these Doctors and Scribes who were also, according
to the custom of those times, called <span class="smcap">Masters</span>, did,
from the most experienced and best of the Disciples, collect and choose
fellow labourers, whence arose the name of Socius. When
others were elected, but not chosen, they were designed, after
the manner of the Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Philosophers,
by the appellation of Disciple.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Beta;)</b> That our Association now, as formerly,
consists of the Three Degrees of Disciple, Fellow, and Master. The last,
or Masters, admitting of Elect Masters and Superior Elect
Masters. But that all Associations or Fraternities so called,
who admit of more or other denominations or subdivisions,
and who ascribe to themselves another origin, and, intermeddling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
with Political and Ecclesiastical affairs, make promises
and protestations under whatever titles they may assume, of
Freemasons and Brethren, attached to the solemnities of
John, or others which belong not to our Order, are to be
expelled and ejected from it as Schismatics.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Gamma;)</b> That among the Doctors, Masters of
this Order, cultivating the Sciences of Mathematics, Astronomy, and other
Studies, a mutual interchange of doctrine and light was maintained,
which led to the practice of electing out of those who
were already Elect Masters, one in particular, who, as excelling
the rest, should be venerated as Supreme Elect Master
or Patriarch. Being known only to the Elect Master,
he was regarded both as the Visible and Invisible Head and
Chief of our whole Association; so that, according to this
Ordnance, the Supreme Master and Patriarch, though known
to very few, yet still exists. The premises being compiled
from the mass of parchments and charter of the Order itself,
committed, by authority of our Patrons, with the sacred documents,
in future to the charge of our Preses and his successors;
and being herewith diligently compared by W. E.
Santona, by authority of the same illustrious Patriarch, ordain
and command as follows:</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Delta;)</b> The government of our society, the
mode and rule according to which the flaming light may be imparted and
diffused among the illuminated brethren, as well as the profane
world, rest entirely with the highest Elect Masters.
To them belongs the charge of watching and taking care, lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
the members, of whatever rank or order, should attempt any
thing contrary to the true principles of our Society. Upon
the same chiefs of the Society are incumbent the defence of
the Order, the preservation and safeguard of its welfare,
which, should occasion require, they are to protect at the
expense of their fortunes, and the risk of their lives, against
all who attack our Institution, whatsoever and wheresoever
this may be done.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Epsilon;)</b> To us it is by no means clear, that
this association of brethren, prior to the year one thousand four hundred
and forty, were known by any other denomination than that of
<i>Joannite Brethren</i>; but at that time we are informed, the
fraternity, especially in Valence in Flanders, began to be
called by the name of <i>Free Masons</i>, from which period, in
some parts of Hanover, Hospitals began to be built by
the aid and pecuniary assistance of the Brethren, for those
who laboured under the Sacred Fire, called St. Anthony's Evil.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Zeta;)</b> Although in works of benevolence we pay
no regard to religion or country, we however consider it safe and necessary
hitherto to receive none into our Order but those who,
in the society of the profane and unenlightened, are professedly
Christians. In conducting the inquisition and trial
of those who apply for the initiation of the First Degree,
which is that of Disciple, no bodily tortures are employed,
but only those trials which tend to develope the nature, inclinations,
and dispositions of the Candidates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Eta;)</b> To those duties which are commanded and
undertaken by a solemn oath, are added those of fidelity and obedience
to the secular rulers, lawfully placed over us.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Theta;)</b> The principle on which we act, and all
these our efforts, to whatever purpose and direction they may tend, are
expressed in these two precepts:&mdash;"Love and regard all men
as Brethren and Relations&mdash;render to God what is God's,
and to Cæsar what is Cæsar's."</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Iota;)</b> The Secrets and Mysteries which veil
our undertakings conduce to this end,&mdash;that without ostentation we
may do good, and without disunion of action, prosecute our designs
to the uttermost.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Kappa;)</b> We celebrate annually the Memory of
St. John the Forerunner of Christ, and Patron of our Community.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Lambda;)</b> These, and the rest of the corresponding
ceremonies of the Institution, though conducted in the meetings of the
Brethren by signs, or speech, or otherwise, do nevertheless
differ totally from the rites of the Churches.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Mu;)</b> The above is considered a Brother of the
Joannite Society, or a Freemason, who, in a lawful manner, by the help,
and under the direction of some Elect Master, with the assistance
of at least seven Brethren, is initiated into our
mysteries, and who is ready to prove his adoption by the
Signs and Tokens which are used by other Brethren; but
in which Signs and Words are included, those which are in
use in The Edinburgh Lodge or Tabernacle and its Affiliated
Lodges; as also in the Hamburgh, Rotterdam, and Middleburg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>
Tabernacles, and in that which is found erected at
Venice, whose ministrations and labours, though they be
ordained after the manner of the Scots, differ not from those
which are used by us, in so far as they respect the origin,
design, and institution.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>(&Nu;)</b> This our Society, being superintended
by one General Prince, while the different governments of which it
consists are ruled by various Superior Masters, adapted to various
regions and kingdoms, as need requires. Nothing is more
necessary than a certain conformity among all those who are
dispersed throughout the whole World, as members of one
aggregate body; and likewise an intercourse of missionaries
and correspondence harmonising with them, and with their
doctrines in all places.&mdash;Wherefore, these present letters,
testifying the nature and spirit of our Society, shall be sent to
all and sundry Colleges of the Order as yet existing. For these

"The Greek Convent adjoins the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. From
the terrace of this Convent, you see a spacious enclosure, in which
grow two or three olive trees, a palm tree, and a few cypresses. The

At a subsequent period, the war-dress of the Knights Hospitallers was
a scarlet tunic, or sopra vest, on which was embroidered the sacred emblem
of the Order. In the Convent, they wore a black robe similarly adorned, with a
cap of dignity. The knights were authorised to wear these dresses by a Bull of
Pope Alexander IV, in 1259. The other insignia were,&mdash;<i>First</i>, A star which
was worn on the left breast, in the form of a cross patée, having eight points,
symbolical of the eight beatitudes and the eight languages, which composed the
Order; <i>Second</i>, A badge formed of a white enamelled cross, having the angles
charged with the supporters, or principal device, of the respective kingdom to
which the language belonged. This, surmounted by an imperial Crown, was
worn originally suspended from the neck by a gold chain, latterly by a black
ribband; to these were added the sword, scarf, spurs, &amp;c. As an armorial distinction,
the knights were privileged to augment their family arms with a chief,
<i>gules</i>, charged with a cross, <i>argent</i>; and exteriorly adorned the shield with the
mantle, cap of dignity, banners, badge, and motto, <i>Pro Fide</i>. These insignia,
however, were of more modern
adoption.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> <span class="smcap">Hospitallaria</span>.</p></div>

<p>The first introduction of the Knights Hospitallers into England took place,
according to Tanner, in 1101. Soon after this, the Grand Priory of St. John,
at Clerkenwell, London, was founded by the Lord Jordan Briset. In 1185 it
was formally dedicated by the Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem. Matthew
Paris mentions that, in 1237, there went from the Priory of Clerkenwell three
hundred knights to the wars in the Holy Land. It was set on fire by the rebels
under Wat Tyler in 1381, and burnt for seven days; and it was not finally repaired
till one hundred and twenty-three years afterwards, when the Grand Prior
Docwra completed its reconstruction. This building is said to have exhibited
curious specimens of the Arts of Europe and Asia, and contained collections of
books and other rarities.&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Cromwell's Hist. Parish Clerkenwell.</span>)</p>

<p>The old gateway of St. John's, Clerkenwell, is nearly all that remains of
the once princely Priory, the revenues of which, at the time of the Reformation,
amounted to the sum of two thousand three hundred and eighty-five pounds
twelve shillings and eightpence sterling. Besides the above, the Order possessed
subordinate priories or establishments in almost every county of England and
Scotland; to which were attached valuable lands, with rights of venison and
fishing, and immunities of various kinds.</p></div>

The other original associates of the Order were the
Knights Roral, Gundemar, Godfrey Bisol, Payens de Montidier,
Archibald de St. Aman, Andrew de Montbar, and the Count of Provence,
according to the German historian, <span class="smcap">Wilcke</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Bauseant</i> or <i>Bausant</i>, was, in old French,
a pie-bald horse. The word is still preserved with its original meaning
in the Scotch dialect, in the form <i>Bawsent</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"His honest, sonsie, baws'nt face,</span>
<span class="i10">Aye gat him freends in ilka place,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>says Burns, describing the "Ploughman's Collie" in his Tale of the
"Twa Dogs;" and in the Glossary, Dr. Currie explains <i>Bawsent</i>
as meaning "having a white stripe down the face." Some conceive that
the word <i>Beauseant</i> may be merely an old variation of the modern
French word <i>Bienséant</i>, as referring to something handsome
or attractive.</p></div>

Expediency afterwards prompted the infraction of this
original rule. Gerard de Ridefort, Grand Master of the Order, was
liberated by Saladin, along with several other captives, for no less
a ransom than the city of Ascalon. In 1244 also, the Templars
endeavoured to redeem their brethren from captivity in Egypt.</p></div>

Mathew Paris charges a certain Templar, named Ferrandus,
with having gone over to the Infidels, and betrayed the state of the
Christian garrison in Damietta, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1221.
This deserter was reputed to have been a knight
"<i>in armis strenuus et consilio circumspectus</i>."</p></div>

The <i>affiliated</i> were persons of various ranks, and of both sexes, who, without
any outward sign of connection, were acknowledged by the Order as entitled to
its protection, and admitted to a participation in certain of its privileges,&mdash;such
as exemption from the effects of ecclesiastical interdicts, which secured to them
at least the occasional service of the mass, and Christian burial in consecrated
ground. These were advantages of the last importance, for which both men and
women, Knights and Burghers, were content to pay considerable sums while
alive, and leave to the Treasury of the Temple the residue of their property after
death.</p>

<p>The <i>donates</i> and <i>oblates</i> stood in a somewhat different relation to the
Order, being personally dedicated or offered, as their titles denote, to the Society.
These were either youths whom their parents destined for the service of the
Order, when they had attained a proper age, or they were adults who bound
themselves gratuitously to aid and assist the Order so long as they lived, solely
in admiration of its sanctity and excellence, a portion of which they humbly
hoped to share. Among these latter, all classes were to be found,&mdash;princes and
priests, as well as other persons. (See Secret Societies of the Middle Ages.)</p></div>

No specific sum appears to have been exacted from entrants, but each was
expected to pay according to his means. Thus it is recorded of the Prince Guy
Dauphin, that he gave to the Order 1500 pieces (Livr. Tourn.) for his own
entry-money, and a contribution of 200 a-year in name of his parents.</p>

<p>Wealthy Squires of the Order, of respectable though not noble parentage,
gave sometimes large sums at their reception. Of this class, Bartholomew
Bartholet gave property to the amount of 1,000 livres Tournois to be admitted,
and William of Liege gave 200 a-year of the same circulation.</p></div>

Hugo de Payens, the founder of the Order, set a laudable example of rigour
in the selection of candidates. When a certain Knight, named Hugo d'Amboise,
was desirous of being received into the Order, the Grand Master refused
to let him take the vows, because he had oppressed the people of Marmoutier,
and disobeyed a judicial sentence of the Count of Anjou; and until he
had given satisfaction to all whom he had injured, and otherwise amended his
life, he was informed that he could not be admitted into the Temple.</p></div>

The Rule of St. Bernard prohibited the Templars from even looking at a
woman. The translation of the statute, chap. lxxii, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We hold it to be dangerous to all religion to look too much on the countenance
of women, and, therefore, let no Brother presume to kiss either widow
or virgin, or mother or sister, or aunt, or any other woman. Let the militia of
Christ, therefore, shun feminine kisses, by which men are often exposed to
danger, that with a pure conscience and secure life, they may walk continually
in the sight of God."</p></div>

Master, William de Chartres, who employed a number of pilgrims of the masonic
class in its erection. Hence the appellation of Pilgrim Castle which it received.</p></div>

The Knights in general seem to have been buried with their swords placed
beside the body. Several skeletons are said to have been found in the Templar

The first preceptory of the Templars in England was founded at Holborn,
then in the suburbs of London, whence they afterwards removed to Fleet Street
about 1185. The only remains of the latter place of residence is the beautiful
circular edifice still called the Temple Church, supposed to have been built after
the model of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. This seems to
have been a favourite form with the Order. The Church of St. Sepulchre at
Cambridge, built by the Templars, is of a circular construction, having the
appearance of a fortified tower. In examining this building (says Mr. Britton)
we are struck with its ponderous and durable appearance, as if it was intended
for a castellated edifice. The masonry of the ancient walls, and also of the
pillars and arches, is such as to evince great skill in the building, the stones
being all squared and chisselled with the most perfect accuracy to fit their respective
places. At Northampton, the same form seems to have been observed.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre (says Pennant, speaking of this place,) was
supposed to have been built by the Knights Templars on the model of that at
Jerusalem. Others of the chapels appertaining to the Order do not, however,
present a similar plan.</p>

<p>The principal Bailliwicks of the Order in England were the following, viz.
London, Kent, Warwick, Waesdone, Lincoln, Lindsey, Bolingbroke, Widine,
Agerstone, York. In these were seventeen preceptories. Most places having
the prefix of <i>Temple</i> belonged to the Knights,&mdash;such as Temple-Bruer in
Lincolnshire, where, Camden says, that in his time there were the ruins of a church
or chapel, "not unlike that of the new Temple at London." Probably it was
of the circular form above noticed. Some account of the Irish preceptories will
be found in the <a href="#Page_xlii">Appendix</a>.</p></div>

This seems somewhat countenanced by the great additions made to the
buildings of the Temple at Paris previous to the arrival of the Grand Master.
In 1306, was erected a large square tower, flanked by four round towers, with
an adjacent building on the north side, surmounted by turrets. The principal
tower contained four stories, in each of which there was an apartment thirty feet
square: three of the inferior towers had also each a hall. The remaining tower
contained a fine staircase, which conducted to the different chambers and battlements.
The walls of the central keep were nine feet in thickness. This <i>Tower
of the Temple</i> has been rendered memorable in modern times by the captivity
of the unfortunate Louis XVI. and his family. It is also noted as the place of
imprisonment, by Buonaparte, of the celebrated Sir Sidney Smith, now the
Head of the Order of the Temple.</p></div>

Jacques de Molay was elected Grand Master in the year 1297, and was the
second elevated to that dignity after the expulsion of the Christians from the
Holy Land. He was of an ancient family in Besançon, Franche Compté, and

It is probable that part of this treasure was formed from the spoils of Greece,
which the Templars had been invited from their retirement to invade, at the instigation
of the King of Sicily. After overrunning great part of that country,
they returned loaded with the plunder of its cities, leaving their possession to
some allies.&mdash;<i>Vide</i> <i>Michaud</i>, <i>Histoire des Croisades</i>.</p></div>

A French writer gives the following opinion regarding the origin of some of
these charges:&mdash;"Les Chevaliers supportaient un grand nombre d'épreuves religieuses
et morales avant de parvenir aux divers degrés d'initiation; ainsi, par
exemple, le récipiendaire pouvait recevoir l'injonction, sous peine de mort, de
fouler aux pieds le crucifix, ou d'adorer une idole; mais, s'il cédait à la terreur
qu'on cherchait à lui inspirer, il était déclaré indigne d'être admis aux grades
élevés de l'Ordre. On conçoit, d'après cela, comment des êtres, trop faibles ou
trop immoraux pour supporter les épreuves d'initiation, ont pu accuser les
Templiers de se livrer a des practiques et d'avoir des croyances infâmes,
superstitieuses."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Recherches Historiques sur
Les Templiers.</span> Paris, 1835.)</p></div>

"Quod clam consueverunt tenere capitula sua;" and "Quod similem
clandestinitatem observant et observare consueverunt ut plurimum in recipiendo
fratres," were principal counts in the indictment against them. From this secrecy,
some writers have inferred that the Templars practised a species of Freemasonry,
of which certainly no direct evidence transpired during the inquest.
Signor Rosetti, the celebrated commentator of Dante, has, we understand, a
work in the press, in which he seeks to demonstrate that the Templars were a
branch of that great secret confederacy which was formed against the papacy,
which included the Troubadours and all the <i>literati</i> of the time, and which
ultimately produced the Reformation. This information is derived from a letter to
Dr. Burnes by Mr. Keightly, the talented reviewer and friend of Rosetti.</p></div>

In June 1310, Pope Clement wrote to the King of England blaming his
lenity, and calling upon him to employ the torture upon the unfortunate Knights.
The Council of London, after a long discussion, ordered it to be employed, but
so as not to mutilate the limbs, or cause an incurable wound, or violent effusion
of blood.</p></div>

The Knights of Christ have continued to exist as a recognized Order of
Knighthood down to the present day. The supremacy is vested in the Sovereign
of Portugal, and the greater part of the revenue is understood to accrue
to the royal coffers. The sums, however, paid in pensions to Knights of the
Order, about the beginning of the present century, are said to have amounted
to about £4000 per annum. In 1793 they possessed twenty-one provincial
towns and villages, and counted four hundred and fifty-four commanderies, exclusive
of colonial acquisitions. The various recent changes, occasioned by war
and intestine commotions, probably have reduced their income and possessions.
In 1820 the Grand Prior of Portugal was Louis Antonio de Fontado, of the
House of Barbasena, and who died in 1832. We are not informed as to his
successor. The Cross of the Order of Christ is sometimes bestowed upon
foreigners as an honorary distinction. Dr. Bowring, (who was employed on a
mission to the Portuguese Government,) and several other Englishmen, have of
late years received its Cross; generally, it is believed, that of the third
class of Knights.</p></div>

<p>The Pope (Clement V.) committed the glaring absurdity of making a provisional
decree to be executed in perpetuity. The Bull which is issued at the
Court at Vienne, without asking the judgment of the assembled bishops and
others, declares, that although he cannot of right, consistently with the Inquisition
and proceedings, pronounce a definite sentence, yet by way of apostolical
provision and regulation, he perpetually prohibited people from entering into
the Order, and calling themselves Templars. The penalty of the greater excommunication
was held out as a punishment for offending.</p>

Besides appropriating to himself all the moveable property of the Order,
three hundred thousand livres of France were retained by the King, ostensibly
to repay the expense of the prosecution. No doubt the treasure brought by De
Molay from Cyprus would be amongst the first booty seized, as well as the rich
gold and silver utensils and plate, with which the chapel and palace of the
Temple at Paris were furnished.</p></div>

On the 28th March 1310, no fewer than 546 Templars were assembled
under a strong guard, in the gardens of the Bishop of Paris, who had been conveyed
thither to make the defence of the Order, and hear read the accusations
against them. This shew of justice was, of course, a mere pretence of their persecutors,
to save appearances. The number of the Templars in Paris afterwards
encreased to nearly 900. Ferrati of Vicenza has reckoned the entire members
of the Order throughout Europe at 15,000 persons.</p></div>

So dreadful and impressive an event could not fail to be the source of many
strange stories with the vulgar. Among these, chroniclers report, that the
venerable martyr, ere life was extinct, summoned Pope Clement to answer before
the bar of the Almighty Judge, within forty days, and King Philip before the
same tribunal, within the space of a year. Certain it is, that the Pope did
suddenly die in the night between the 19th and 20th of the following month;
and the church in which his body was placed taking fire, one-half of the corpse
was consumed,&mdash;a circumstance which naturally confirmed the people in the
belief that his death was a special judgment of Heaven for the burning of the
knights, and which probably also suggested the prediction. In the month of July
following, a tumult arose in the town where the half consumed corpse was
kept, during which the populace tried to get forcible possession of the remains;
but whether from some superstitious motive, or with a view of avenging on the
Pope's body the murder of De Molay, is not known. Philip of France expired
within the year, in consequence of a fall from his horse, and others of the
persecutors of the Order met a violent death.</p></div>

The following anecdote of Sir Sidney Smith may not be inappropriate here,
as relating to a Soldier of the Cross:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the signal defeat of Buonaparte at Acre, the tyrant Djezzar, to avenge
himself upon the Franks, inflicted severe punishment on the Jewish and Christian
inhabitants of Saphet, and, it is said, had resolved to massacre all the
believers in Moses and Jesus Christ, who might be found within his dominions.
But Sir Sidney Smith, on being apprized of his intention, instantly caused the
Turk to be informed, that if a single Christian head should fall, he would bombard
Acre, and burn it about his ears. This decisive interposition of the gallant
Admiral is still remembered in the hearts of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Such was the confidence placed by them in their deliverer, that Burckhardt,
alluding to Sir Sidney, says,&mdash;"His word, I have often heard both Turks
and Christians exclaim, was like God's word&mdash;it never failed;" and Professor
Lo&#283;we, recently returned from Palestine, affirmed, that the Firmaun of Sir
Sidney at once procured for him, both from the Sultan and the Pacha of Egypt,
every assistance and facility in pursuing his learned hieroglyphical and
mythological researches.</p>

<p>In connection with our subject, it may be mentioned as a singular fact, that
Sir Sidney Smith was the first Christian ever permitted to enter the Holy City
of Jerusalem armed, since the days of the Crusaders, which he was allowed to
do as a special compliment, after the surrender of the French army in Egypt.
By his means, also, his followers were granted the like privilege.</p>

of, still exists through its members, scattered over Europe. Few, if any,
of the old Knights who belonged to the Order in its palmy days are now alive.
One of the last of these was the Chevalier Gr&#283;che, who died at Malta in 1838,
where he had continued to linger amid the scenes of his Order's former greatness
and glory. He was of a French family, and, it is said, spoke French of the time of
Louis XIV. He was page to the last Grand Master at Malta, in which capacity
there is a full-length portrait of him in the palace of a Portuguese Knight.
He often used to look at this picture; pointing the while to his wrinkles
and white hair, and laughing at the change from the fair face and flowing
locks represented in the painting. Until he became very infirm, he was fond
of society, and was frequently to be met with at the houses of the English,
by whom he was much esteemed on account of his interesting recollections and
traditions. It is believed that there now remains only one member of the Order
as it existed before the dispersion, and he belongs to the <i>Langue d'Italie</i>.

We shall be excused referring to this subject, considering that it engaged
so much of the attention of the pious St. Bernard. Respecting the habit of the
early Templars, he says, chap, xxii and xxv, "It is granted unto none to wear
white tunics or mantles, but to the Knights of Christ.&mdash;If any brother wish to
have the handsomest or best mantle, either as of due or out of pride, for such
presumption, he will, without doubt, deserve the very worst."</p></div>

Pro Deo et Patria. This is one of the present mottoes of the Order. The
other, Ferro non auro se muniunt, is taken from the following striking expressions
of St. Bernard,&mdash;"Equites Christi intus fide, foras ferro non auro se
muniunt, non turbulenti aut impetuosi, et quasi ex levitate præcipites, sed consulte
atque cum omni cautela et providentia se ipsos ordinentes, et disponentes

La société des Templiers vient d'en offrir une preuve éclatante, à l'occasion
du mariage de S. M. l'Empereur et Roi avec Marie Louise, d'Autriche.
Le 16 Août 1810, elle a donné une fête, terminée par une distribution de vêtemens,
des vivres et d'argent à des vieillards indigens choisis dans les douze
municipalités des Paris. On peut voir dans le proces verbal qu'ils en out fait

En 1811, Napoleon, empereur, revenant a ses idées sur l'importance de cet
ordre, tant sous le rapport civil que sous le rapport religieux, fit appeler le grand-maitre
Bernard-Raymond, et après plusieurs questions a sa maniere sur l'êtat actuel
de l'ordre, sur ses statuts, etc. il s'informa des époques de ses assemblées. Apprenant
qu'il y en aurait bientôt une pour la célébration de l'anniversaire du martyre
de Jacques de Molay, l'empereur s'empara de cette circonstance, et donna des ordres
pour que cette ceremonie se fit publiquement avec une grand pompe religieuse et
militaire. Une place d'honneur était réservée pour le grand-maitre et ses lieutenans
generaux. M. Clouet, chanoine de Notre-Dame, coadjuteur-general du
primat du Temple, et revêtu du camail primatial, prononça l'oraison funèbre du
grand-maitre martyr, dont le catafalque était richement orné des insignes de la
souveraineté magistrale et patriarcale. On peut se souvenir de l'étonnement que
produisit cette grande ceremonie par sa publicité, ainsi que des conjectures auxquelles
elle donna lieu; tout porte à croire que l'empereur se proposait de tirer
bon parti de l'ordre du Temple et de son culte s'il ne pouvait parvenir a maîtriser
a cour de Rome.</p>

<p>L'empereur don Pedro, après avoir accepté le titre de premier chevalier
d'honneur du Temple, autorisa un de ses ministres a recevoir le brevet de grand-prieur
titulaire du Bresil; et l'on ne peut douter, d'après la correspondance de
ce ministre avec le grand-maitre Bernard-Raymond, que don Pedro n'eut
l'intention de faire refleurir l'ordre du Temple au Bresil, comme aussi il avait
êté sauvé de sa destruction en 1312 par le roi Denis, qui créa l'ordre des chevaliers
proscrits par le décret de Clement V.&mdash;</p>

The original name of Temple on the Southesk, according to Chalmers, was
Balantrodach. In the Chartular of Aberdeen the Preceptory is styled "domus
Templi de Balantradock;" and in the Chartular of the Abbey of Newbattle we
find mentioned, "Magister et Fratres Templi de Blentodoch," which is a contraction
or corruption of the same term. The place became known by the designation
of Temple only after the establishment of the Order there. This
was the head-quarters of the Grand Preceptors of Scotland, and became, at the
suppression of the Templars, attached to the Hospital of St. John. In the 15th
century, Sir William Knolls, Grand Preceptor of St. John's, obtained an Act of
Parliament, changing the old name into that of the barony of St. John. But
the people never conformed to the alteration. Part of the foundations of the
original convent were dug up about a century ago. The ancient chapel of the
Temple continued till lately to be used as the parish kirk. It is now partly
dilapidated, in consequence of a new church being built. On the eastern gable
there is an antique inscription, formed with lead run into the letters, which
appears to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><b>V Æ S A C</b></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;"><b>M T H M.</b></span><br /></p>

<p>These letters, when extended, may signify, <i>Vitæ Sacrum Militiæ Templi
Hierosolymitani</i>; or, <i>Virgini Ædem Sacram Militiæ Templi Hierosolymæ Majister</i>;
supplying <i>condidit</i> or <i>consecravit</i>. The Virgin Mary, it is well known, was the
patroness of the Order. What monstrous mysteries would not the ingenious
Von Hammer make these letters the vehicle of revealing! In the second line
the learned German could not fail to discover the presence of the <i>Metis</i> or <i>Tau</i>
of the Gnostics, whose doctrines, he insists, the Templars held, as attested by
their monumental remains, and by coins or medals imagined to refer to them.</p></div>

This gallant Templar,&mdash;worthy to have fallen in a holier cause,&mdash;is thus
strangely vilified, after death, by some miscreant, at the trial of the Templars:&mdash;"Brian
le J&#257;y dixit quod Jesus Christus non fuit verus Deus et vérus homo;
quod minimus pilus barbæ unius Saraceni fuit majoris valoris quam totum corpus
istius qui loquitur. Pauperibus quibusdam eleemosynam a Briane petentibus
pro amore Dei et beatæ Mariæ Virginis respondit, 'Que dame, allez vous pendre
à votre dame;' et projiciens impetuose unum quadrantem in luto, fecit pauperes
musare in eodem et hoc tempore frigidæ hyemis." Such is a sample of the evidence
against the Order.</p></div>

It appears by the following extract from Clifton's examination, that the Preceptor
of Scotland was a subordinate officer to the Master, or Grand Prior in
England. "Interrogatus; quis recepit eum ad dictum ordinem et dedit ei habitum?

The medal alluded to was struck at the expense of the Chapitre du Choix
at Paris, to celebrate the establishment in France of a Provincial Grand Lodge
of Heredom de Kilwinning, by a Charter, dated Edinburgh the 1st of May 1786,
constituting Mr. John Mattheus, a distinguished merchant of Rouen, Provincial
Chief, with very ample powers, to disseminate the Order. The Chapitre du
Choix was itself erected by a charter from Edinburgh in the same year, addressed
to Nicholas Chabouille, avocat en parlement, and other brethren. Both
these documents bear the signatures of William Charles Little, Deputy Grand
Master, William Mason, and William Gibb. At a later date, a Provincial
Grand Master was also appointed for Spain, in the person of Mr. James Gordon,
a merchant at Xeres de la Frontera, whose commission was signed by Deputy
Grand Master Dr. Thomas Hay, and Messrs. Charles Moor and John Brown, as
heads of the Royal Order. In 1811, there were no less than twenty-six Chapters
of Heredom holding of the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Order in France, including
some in Belgium and Italy.</p>

The reader will find the Preceptor's motives and proceedings explained in an
authentic family document printed from a manuscript copy in the Advocates Library,
in a little work named, "Templaria. Edinburgh, 1828." We extract from
it the following account of the surrender of the Preceptory:&mdash;"He personally
compeirit in presence of the Queen's Majesty, the Lord Chancelour, the Earles of
Murray, Marischall, and diuers others of her Hiehnes Privy Council, and there, as
the only lawful undoubted Titular, and present possessor of the Lordship and Preceptorie
of Torphephen, which was never subject to any Chapter or Conuent whatsomever,
except only the Knights of Jerusalem and Temple of Solomon, Genibus
flexis et reverentia qua decuit, resigned and ouergave in the hands of our Souerane
Lady, his undoubted Superior, ad perpetuam remanentiam, all Right, Property,
and Possession, which he had, or any way could pretend to the said Preceptorie,
or any part thereof, in all time Coming; to the effect the same might remain perpetually,
with her Hyeness and her Successours, as a Part of Property and Patrimony
of her Crown for ever. After this resignation in the Queen's Majesty's
hands, ad Remanentiam, of this Benefice, be the lawful Titular thereof, her Hyeness,
in remembrance of the good service of the said Sir James Sandilands, gave
and grantid and dispon'd, in feu-farme, heritably, to the said Sir James, his
heirs and assignies, All and Haill, the said Preceptorie and Lordship."</p>

<p>That the payment of the above sum of ten thousand crowns of the Sun subsequently
involved Sandilands in serious difficulties and embarrassments, we
are instructed by the works referred to, in which it is stated that&mdash;"albeit
the charter bears present payment of ten thousand crowns, that the money
was paid at divers times, partly upon Her Majesty's precepts to her
servants, French Paris, Sir Robert Melvin, Sir James Balfour, and Captain Anstruther;
and the rest of the sum to Mr. Robert Richardson, treasurer for the
time, whereof there is a receipt under the privy seal. That a great part of that
money, numbered in gold and silver, was borrowed from Timothy Corneoli, an
Italian gentleman of the Preceptor's acquaintance at Genoa, and a banker of the
house of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;resident in Scotland for the time. That this nobleman
being burthened with great debts, for his exoneration and relief, was forced to
let in feu-farm his own roumes for a reasonable composition," &amp;c.; and he was
afterwards obliged to part with some of the larger baronies of the estate.</p></div>

On this subject we shall let the Baron de Hund speak for himself:&mdash;Les
Frères de la Stricte-Observance se disent les successeurs des Templiers, et leur
doctrine consiste a perpétuer l'existence de l'Ordre sous le voile de la Franche
Maçonnerie. Voici l'Histoire de l'Institution, selon le Baron de Hund; Dans
l'année 1303, deux Chevaliers, nommés Noffodoi et Florian, furent punis pour
crimes. Tous deux perdirent leurs commanderies et particulièrement, le dernier,
celle de Montfaucon. Ils en demandérent de nouvelles au Gr.-Maître provincial
de Mont-Carmel; et comme il les leur refusa, ils l'assassinérent dans sa maison
de campagne, prés de Milan, et cachérent son corps dans le jardin, sous des
arbrisseaux. Ils se refugiérent ensuite á Paris, ou ils accusérent l'Ordre des
crimes les plus horribles, ce qui entraina sa perte, et par suite le supplice de J.
Molay. Après la catastrophe, le Grand-Maître provincial de l'Auvergne, Pierre
d'Aumont, s'enfuit avec deux Commandeurs et cinq Chevaliers. Pour n'être
point reconnus, ils se deguisérent en ouvriers maçons, et se refugiérent dans une
ile Ecossaise, ou ils trouvérent le Grand-Commandeur Haupton-court, Georges
de Hasris, et plusieurs autres Frères avec lesquels ils resolurent de continuer
l'Ordre. Ils tinrent, le jour de St.-Jean 1313, un Chapitre dans lequel Aumont,
premier du nom, fut nommé Grand-Maitre. Pour'se soustraire aux persécutions,
ils empruntèrent des symboles pris dans l'art de la Maçonnerie, et se denommérent
Maçons libres.... En 1361, le Grand-Maitre du Temple transporta son siege a
Aberdeen, et par suite l'Ordre se repandit, sous le voile de la Fr.-Maçonnerie,
en Italie, en Allemagne, en France, en Portugal, en Espagne et ailleurs. Der
Signatsterne, etc., p. 178.</p></div>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
